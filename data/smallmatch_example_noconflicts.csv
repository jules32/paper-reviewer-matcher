408,Xiaoyu Zhuang,"To inhibit the abnormal aggregation of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy of SOD1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Herein the interactions between SOD1 and four stilbene-based polyphenols, namely resveratrol, oxyresveratrol, polydatin and 2,3, 4', 5-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glycoside (THSG), were investigated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) combined with ion mobility (IM) spectrometry. The addition of tandem MS to the study of SOD1-ligand complexes provides further insight into their gas-phase stability. Monitoring the unfolding of SOD1-ligand complexes using IM-MS allows observation of subtle changes in the protein stability upon ligand binding. From the MS/MS and IM-MS measurements, polydatin and THSG were highlighted as the strongest bound compounds¬¬¬ in the gas phase, both of them appear to provide a stabilizing effect on the SOD1 dimer conformation. In addition, the data of fluorescence assays clearly show the ability of the ligands to inhibit apoSOD1 from aggregation, and polydatin was found to have the strongest inhibitory effect. Overall, the method described here can be an effective approach to investigate the interactions between SOD1 and other drug-like molecules."
596,Carmit Gal,"The acquisition and retention of motor skills is necessary for everyday functioning in the elderly and may be critical in the context of motor rehabilitation. Recent studies indicate that motor training closely followed by sleep may result in better engagement of procedural (""how to"") memory consolidation processes in the elderly. Nevertheless, elderly individuals are mostly morning oriented and a common practice is to time rehabilitation programs to morning hours. Here, we tested whether the time-of-day wherein training is afforded (morning, 8-10:30 a.m., or evening, 6-9 p.m.) affects the long-term outcome of a multi-session motor practice program (10 sessions across 3-4 weeks) in healthy elderly participants. Twenty-nine (15 women) older adults (60-75 years) practiced an explicitly instructed five-element key-press sequence by repeatedly generating the sequence ""as fast and accurately as possible."" The groups did not differ in terms of sleep habits and quality (1-week long actigraphy); all were morning-oriented individuals. All participants gained robustly from the intervention, shortening sequence tapping duration and retaining the gains (> 90%) at 1-month post-intervention, irrespective of the time-of-day of training. However, retesting at 7-months post-intervention showed that the attrition of the training induced gains was more pronounced in the morning trained group compared to the evening group (76 and 56.5% loss in sequence tapping time; 7/14 and 3/14 participants showed a > 5% decline in accuracy relative to end of training, respectively). Altogether, the results show that morning-oriented older adults effectively acquired skill in the performance of a sequence of finger movements, in both morning and evening practice sessions. However, evening training leads to a significant advantage, over morning training, in the long-term retention of the skill. Evening training should be considered an appropriate time window for motor skill learning in older adults, even in individuals with morning chronotype. The results are in line with the notion that motor training preceding a sleep interval may be better consolidated into long-term memory in the elderly, and thus result in lower forgetting rates."
460,Raymond Pomponio,"As medical imaging enters its information era and presents rapidly increasing needs for big data analytics, robust pooling and harmonization of imaging data across diverse cohorts with varying acquisition protocols have become critical. We describe a comprehensive effort that merges and harmonizes a large-scale dataset of 10,477 structural brain MRI scans from participants without a known neurological or psychiatric disorder from 18 different studies that represent geographic diversity. We use this dataset and multi-atlas-based image processing methods to obtain a hierarchical partition of the brain from larger anatomical regions to individual cortical and deep structures and derive age trends of brain structure through the lifespan (3-96 years old). Critically, we present and validate a methodology for harmonizing this pooled dataset in the presence of nonlinear age trends. We provide a web-based visualization interface to generate and present the resulting age trends, enabling future studies of brain structure to compare their data with this reference of brain development and aging, and to examine deviations from ranges, potentially related to disease."
594,Xinjie Chen,"Objective: To investigate changes in brain function at the regional and whole-brain levels in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD) complicated by sleep disorder (SD) by regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images. Materials and Methods: ReHo and seed-based FC analyses were conducted among 32 patients with TDPD and SD (TDPD-SD), 24 with TDPD and no SD (TDPD-NSD), and 23 healthy controls (HCs) to assess spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Correlation analyses were used to examine the associations between brain activity and the clinical data. Results: Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) ReHo values differed significantly among the groups. ACC ReHo values were increased in TDPD-SD vs. HC and TDPD-SD vs. TDPD-NSD. ACC ReHo values were reduced in TDPD-NSD vs. HC. TDPD-SD ReHo values were positively correlated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (r = 0.41, p = 0.020) but negatively correlated with Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) scores (r = -0.38, p = 0.030). FC analysis using ACC as a mask showed that FC of the left olfactory cortex (L-OC), right straight gyrus (R-SG), right superior parietal gyrus (R-SPG), and right precuneus differed significantly among the groups. FC values between R-SG and ACC were significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in TDPD-NSD, while the FC of L-OC and R-OC with ACC was significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in HC. FC between ACC and L-OC, R-SPG, and the right precuneus was lower in TDPD-NSD than in HC. There was no correlation between the FC values and other clinical data in any of the groups. Conclusion: Localized abnormal activity in TDPD-SD was chiefly triggered by ACC. The change in the ReHo of ACC is closely related to the severity of TDPD-associated SD, revealing the role of this region as a regulator of the sleep mechanism in TDPD. Significant abnormal FC was found between R-SG and ACC in TDPD-SD but was not shown to correlate with clinical data."
564,Mihaela Lorger,"Immune checkpoints restrain the immune system following its activation and their inhibition unleashes anti-tumor immune responses. Immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of several cancer types, including melanoma, and immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is becoming a frontline therapy in metastatic melanoma. Notably, up to 60% of metastatic melanoma patients develop metastases in the brain. Brain metastases (BrM) are also very common in patients with lung and breast cancer, and occur in ∼20-40% of patients across different cancer types. Metastases in the brain are associated with poor prognosis due to the lack of efficient therapies. In the past, patients with BrM used to be excluded from immune-based clinical trials due to the assumption that such therapies may not work in the context of ""immune-specialized"" environment in the brain, or may cause harm. However, recent trials in patients with BrM demonstrated safety and intracranial activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We here discuss how immune checkpoint therapy works in BrM, with focus on T cells and the cross-talk between BrM, the immune system, and tumors growing outside the brain. We discuss major open questions in our understanding of what is required for an effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in BrM."
422,Terence E Imbery,"OBJECTIVE
Describe long-term trends and stability of hearing outcomes for patients undergoing primary congenital aural atresia (CAA) repair.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective chart review.


SETTING
Single academic, tertiary referral center.


PATIENTS
Children and adults who underwent primary CAA repair between 1980 and 2017.


INTERVENTION
CAA repair.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Long-term (> 1 yr) postoperative three-tone (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) air conduction pure-tone average (AC PTA) compared with the immediate (within 90 d of surgery) postoperative audiogram.


RESULTS
The mean preoperative AC PTA was 59.6 dB HL. CAA repair improved hearing an average of 30.5 dB, but hearing declined by 8.2 dB over the long-term follow-up period (mean 4.4 yr; range 1-15.7 yr), leaving a final mean improvement of 22.2 dB (final mean AC PTA 37.3 dB HL). Two-thirds (92 of 138 ears) had an AC PTA ≤ 30 dB HL recorded in the first year after surgery. At the last follow-up test, 64% had ""stable"" hearing defined as no more than a 10 dB decline in AC PTA compared with the immediate postoperative audiogram; 21% had a 10 to 20 dB decline, 8% a 20 to 30 dB decline, and 7% declined > 30 dB.


CONCLUSIONS
All patients enjoyed improvement in AC PTA after surgery (preoperative minus the best postoperative PTA, mean = 34 dB, range = 3.3-52 dB). Hearing declined by an average 8.2 dB over the long-term leaving a final average AC PTA of 37.4 dB HL. Sixty-four percent of patients exhibited stable (< 10 dB loss) hearing over time; 36% lost 10 dB or more over the long-term follow-up period. Hearing results typically stabilize over time with most of the change occurring in the first 3 years after CAA repair. Bone conduction thresholds remained stable over the study period."
846,Haley Gittleman,"Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most malignant glioma. Nonglioblastoma (non-GBM) gliomas (WHO Grades II and III) are invasive and also often fatal. The goal of this study is to determine whether sex differences exist in glioma survival.


Methods
Data were obtained from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for years 2010 to 2014. GBM (WHO Grade IV; N = 2073) and non-GBM (WHO Grades II and III; N = 2963) were defined using the histology grouping of the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States. Non-GBM was divided into oligodendrogliomas/mixed gliomas and astrocytomas. Sex differences in survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for known prognostic variables.


Results
There was a female survival advantage in patients with GBM both in the unadjusted (P = .048) and adjusted (P = .003) models. Unadjusted, median survival was 20.1 months (95% CI: 18.7-21.3 months) for women and 17.8 months (95% CI: 16.9-18.7 months) for men. Adjusted, median survival was 20.4 months (95% CI: 18.9-21.6 months) for women and 17.5 months (95% CI: 16.7-18.3 months) for men. When stratifying by age group (18-55 vs 56+ years at diagnosis), this female survival advantage appeared only in the older group, adjusting for covariates (P = .017). Women (44.1%) had a higher proportion of methylated MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) than men (38.4%). No sex differences were found for non-GBM.


Conclusions
Using the NCDB data, there was a statistically significant female survival advantage in GBM, but not in non-GBM."
233,Natascia De Lucia,"OBJECTIVE
Patients with Huntington's disease (HD) may show impairments of frontal cortical-subcortical circuits with difficulties on cognitive flexibility tasks. One marker of poor flexibility is ""perseveration"" behavior, which refers to inappropriate and involuntary production of iterative responses not adequate to the current task demands. This study explored frequency, type, and possible cognitive mechanisms of verbal perseverations in a large sample of HD patients.


METHOD
A sample of 128 patients with HD underwent phonological and category verbal fluency tests to assess perseverative errors, within a wide neuropsychological, psychopathological, motor, and functional assessment.


RESULTS
Perseverative errors in verbal fluency task occurred in 89 (69.5%) patients. Patients showing perseverations scored significantly lower than patients without perseverations on tasks tapping executive and motor functions and on functional independence scales. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant independent association of verbal perseverations with scores on Trail Making Test only. Conclusions: Verbal perseverations are frequent in HD patients and are likely related with impairments of attentional switching and working memory, hampering tracking of verbal responses already produced. Perseverative behavior may serve as a useful clinical marker of cognitive and functional impairment in patients with HD."
782,Natasha L Wilkins,"Clinical methods for determining the severity of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and long-term functional outcome in the acute setting are limited in their prognostic accuracy due to the heterogeneity of injury and dynamic injury progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the timecourse and sensitivity of advanced MRI methods to neurological function after SCI in a rat contusion model. Rats received a graded contusion injury at T10 using a weight-drop apparatus. MRI consisted of morphological measures from T2-weighted imaging, quantitative T2-imaging, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 1, 30, and 90 days post injury (dpi). The derived metrics were compared with neurological function assessed using weekly Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scoring, and return of reflexive micturition function. At the acute timepoint (1 dpi), diffusion metrics sensitive to axonal injury at the injury epicenter had the strongest correlation with time-matched BBB scores and best predicted 90 dpi BBB scores. At 30 dpi, axonal water fraction (AWF) derived from DWI and T2 values were both correlated with time-matched locomotor scores. At the chronic timepoint (90 dpi), cross sectional area (CSA) was most closely correlated to BBB. Overall, the results demonstrate differential sensitivity of MRI metrics at different timepoints after injury, but the metrics follow the expected pathology of acute axonal injury followed by continued degeneration and finally a terminal level of atrophy. The specificity of DWI in the acute setting may make it impactful as a prognostic tool while T2 imaging provided the most information about injury severity in chronic injury."
654,Rechdi Ahdab,"BACKGROUND
Somatotopy is considered the hallmark of the primary motor cortex. While this is fundamentally true for the major body parts (head, upper and lower extremities), evidence supporting the existence of within-limb somatotopy is scarce.


METHOD
We report a young man presenting recurrent ischemic strokes with selective finger weakness in whom serial motor cortex mapping procedures were performed.


RESULT
Following the first stroke, which largely spared the motor cortex, motor mapping displayed overlap of the motor representations of the hand muscles. The second focal stroke, affecting the lateral part of the hand knob, resulted in selective loss of the first dorsal interosseous muscle motor evoked potentials while sparing those of the adductor digiti minimi muscle. This observation is in apparent contradiction with the first mapping results that suggested complete overlap of motor representations.


DISCUSSION
Our mapping results provide evidence for the existence of very precise within-limb somatotopy and confirm the proposed homuncular order, whereby lateral fingers are represented laterally and medial fingers medially. The discrepancy between the initial and subsequent mapping results is discussed in light of functional organization of the primary motor cortex."
300,Daniel Münch,"Behavioral neuroscience aims to describe a causal relationship between neuronal processes and behavior. Animals' ever-changing physiological needs alter their internal states. Internal states then alter neuronal processes to adapt the behavior of the animal enabling it to meet its needs. Here, we describe nutrient-specific appetites as an attractive framework to study how internal states shape complex neuronal processes and resulting behavioral outcomes. Understanding how neurons detect nutrient states and how these are integrated at the level of neuronal circuits will provide a multilevel description of the mechanisms underlying complex feeding and foraging decisions."
78,Samuel G McClugage,"PURPOSE
Delayed intracranial hypertension (DIH) occurs most frequently in children with syndromic or multi-suture synostosis after surgical correction. The rarity of DIH in children with isolated non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (ISS) warrants follow-up evaluation by large craniofacial centers until skeletal maturity. This study reports the incidence of DIH in children following open repair for ISS by our center's craniofacial team.


METHODS
A single-center retrospective study of patients who underwent open calvarial vault remodeling (CVR) for ISS at our institution between November 2000 and November 2012 was performed. Syndromic and multi-suture synostosis patients were excluded. Demographic and follow-up data were extracted from the medical record for analysis until July 2017.


RESULTS
One hundred five patients with ISS were identified who had undergone CVR in the aforementioned timeframe. Average age at initial surgery was 11.7 ± 15.32 months. Mean follow-up in our craniofacial clinic was 4.94 ± 3.53 years, with 69 patients (65.7%) having follow-up in craniofacial clinic ≥ 3 years and 74 (70.5%) having follow-up ≥ 3 years in any clinic at our institution. Four patients (3.8%) had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors placed for symptoms concerning for DIH, one of which (0.95%) had confirmed DIH and underwent a second surgical procedure at 7.4 years of age. The patient presented late initially, having his first operation at 1.56 years of age.


CONCLUSION
One patient out of 105 (0.95%) developed DIH, confirmed by ICP monitoring, and required reoperation. The occurrence of DIH, albeit rare, remains an important topic to include in parental discussions and mandates long-term follow-up in this population."
316,Mario Stampanoni Bassi,"OBJECTIVES
Skill acquisition after motor training involves synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in primary motor cortex (M1). In multiple sclerosis (MS), LTP failure ensuing from neuroinflammation could contribute to worsen clinical recovery. We therefore addressed whether practice-dependent plasticity is altered in MS.


METHODS
Eighteen relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients and eighteen healthy controls performed 600 fast abductions of index finger in 30 blocks of 20 movements. Before and after practice, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered over the hot spot of the trained first dorsal interosseous muscle. Movements kinematics, measures of cortical excitability, and the input/output curves of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were assessed.


RESULTS
Kinematic variables of movement improved with practice in patients and controls to a similar extent, although patients showed lower MEPs amplitude increase after practice. Practice did not change the difference in resting motor threshold values observed between patients and controls, nor did modulate short-interval intracortical inhibition. Clinical/radiological characteristics were not associated to practice-dependent effects.


CONCLUSIONS
Practice-induced reorganization of M1 is altered in non-disabled RR-MS patients, as shown by impaired MEPs modulation after motor learning.


SIGNIFICANCE
These findings suggest that in RR-MS physiological mechanisms of practice-dependent plasticity are altered."
335,Linghong Guo,"Purpose
Alcohol dependence (AD) is a relapsing mental disorder, typically occurring with concurrent tobacco misuse. Studies have reported disruption of the structural connectivity between hemispheres in the brain of individuals with AD. However, alterations in interhemispheric interactions and the specificity of frequency bands in individuals with AD remain unknown. Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) allows examination of functional interactions between mirrored interhemispheric voxels. Here, we use VMHC to investigate homotopic connectivity in AD and alcohol and nicotine co-dependence (AND) subjects.


Patients and methods
VMHC and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) in 24 AD, 30 AND, and 35 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were calculated for different frequency bands (slow-5, slow-4, and typical bands).


Results
Individuals with AD demonstrated significantly reduced VMHC in bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) and increased VMHC in bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) compared to that in HCs in the typical and slow-4 bands; higher VMHC in the MFG was positively correlated with the dependence-severity score. In all bands of the VMHC analysis, no significant differences were found between the AND and other groups. Subsequent seed-based FC analysis demonstrated all regions with abnormal VMHC exhibited altered FC with its counterpart in the contralateral hemisphere in the typical and slow-4 frequency bands. The FC value between bilateral CPL within AD subjects negatively correlated with alcohol intake.


Conclusion
Our findings provide further evidence of the role of disruptions within the brain circuitry supporting cognitive control in the development of AD. Alterations in neural activities in the CPL and MFG might be a biomarker of dependence severity in AD patients as assessed using clinical questionnaire and features. Because of the frequency specificity in VMHC, we must consider frequency effects in future AD functional magnetic resonance imaging studies."

MRI is integral to the diagnostic work-up of congenital and acquired disorders of the central nervous system in newborns, and imaging findings are central to prognostication. This paper reviews techniques to optimize assessment of maturity of the neonatal brain, as well as abnormalities and injuries of the newborn brain that are associated with abnormal neurocognitive development."
649,Yana Suchy,"Objective: Executive functioning (EF) is critical for performance of instrumental activities of daily living, including medication management. Under complex conditions, daily activities require greater EF resources. This study examined if older adults who exhibit weaknesses in EF are at an increased risk for mismanaging their medications under complex contexts.Method: Participants were 50 non-Hispanic white community-dwelling older adults, ages 60-85. At a baseline visit, EF was assessed using the Push-Turn-Taptap task, and daily life complexity and medication regimen complexity were assessed using a structured interview. Medication management across the subsequent 8 weeks was assessed by weekly pill counts.Results: A general linear regression using at-home medication management as the dependent variable showed that EF and the interaction between EF and life complexity were significant predictors (both p values < .001). Specifically, life complexity had a deleterious impact on medication management, but only for older adults whose EF performance was in the bottom 22% of the sample. There was no association between medication regimen complexity and accuracy of medication management.Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that older adults who have even mild EF weaknesses are at an increased risk for mismanaging their medication when leading complex daily lives. These findings add support for the Contextually Valid Executive Assessment (ConVExA) model, which asserts that EF interacts with contextual factors as a predictor of functional outcomes."
40,Rebecca Calafiore,"BACKGROUND
Epstein-Barr virus associated smooth muscle tumors are rare neoplasms that have been found to develop in immunocompromised patients. Three distinct groups of affected patients have been described; 1) HIV-infected patients (HIV-SMT), 2) post-transplant patients (PT-SMT), and 3) patients with congenital immunodeficiency (CI-SMT). The tumors can develop anywhere in the body, with seventeen reported cases occurring in the spinal canal, all in patients with HIV-infection.


CASE DESCRIPTION
We report the first case of EBV-SMT affecting the spinal canal in a post-bone marrow transplant adult patient. Interestingly, unlike other reported cases, the patient described here had not been receiving immunosuppressive therapy in the two years prior to diagnosis of the tumor.


CONCLUSION
Despite the growing number of case reports, this diagnosis presents a challenge, as the pathophysiology and optimal treatment regimens are not well understood. Results of a literature review of EBV-SMT of the spine as well as a discussion of the presentation, management, and prognosis of this condition is presented here."
570,Simon M Danner,"Commissural interneurons (CINs) mediate interactions between rhythm-generating locomotor circuits located on each side of the spinal cord and are necessary for left-right limb coordination during locomotion. While glutamatergic V3 CINs have been implicated in left-right coordination, their functional connectivity remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and modeling approaches. We employed Sim1Cre/+; Ai32 mice, in which light-activated Channelrhodopsin-2 was selectively expressed in V3 interneurons. Fictive locomotor activity was evoked by NMDA and 5-HT in the isolated neonatal lumbar spinal cord. Flexor and extensor activities were recorded from left and right L2 and L5 ventral roots, respectively. Bilateral photoactivation of V3 interneurons increased the duration of extensor bursts resulting in a slowed down on-going rhythm. At high light intensities, extensor activity could become sustained. When light stimulation was shifted toward one side of the cord, the duration of extensor bursts still increased on both sides, but these changes were more pronounced on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side. Additional bursts appeared on the ipsilateral side not seen on the contralateral side. Further increase of the stimulation could suppress the contralateral oscillations by switching to a sustained extensor activity, while the ipsilateral rhythmic activity remained. To delineate the function of V3 interneurons and their connectivity, we developed a computational model of the spinal circuits consisting of two (left and right) rhythm generators (RGs) interacting via V0V, V0D, and V3 CINs. Both types of V0 CINs provided mutual inhibition between the left and right flexor RG centers and promoted left-right alternation. V3 CINs mediated mutual excitation between the left and right extensor RG centers. These interactions allowed the model to reproduce our current experimental data, while being consistent with previous data concerning the role of V0V and V0D CINs in securing left-right alternation and the changes in left-right coordination following their selective removal. We suggest that V3 CINs provide mutual excitation between the spinal neurons involved in the control of left and right extensor activity, which may promote left-right synchronization during locomotion."
155,Wenjing Zhang,"Abnormal neuroanatomic brain networks have been reported in schizophrenia, but their characterization across patients with psychotic disorders, and their potential alterations in nonpsychotic relatives, remain to be clarified. Participants recruited by the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes consortium included 326 probands with psychotic disorders (107 with schizophrenia (SZ), 87 with schizoaffective disorder (SAD), 132 with psychotic bipolar disorder (BD)), 315 of their nonpsychotic first-degree relatives and 202 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the participant groups. Compared with healthy controls, psychotic probands showed decreased nodal efficiency mainly in bilateral superior temporal regions. These regions had altered morphological relationships primarily with frontal lobe regions, and their network-level alterations were associated with positive symptoms of psychosis. Nonpsychotic relatives showed lower nodal centrality metrics in the prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions, and higher nodal centrality metrics in the left cingulate cortex and left thalamus. Diagnosis-specific analysis indicated that individuals with SZ had lower nodal efficiency in bilateral superior temporal regions than controls, probands with SAD only exhibited lower nodal efficiency in the left superior and middle temporal gyrus, and individuals with psychotic BD did not show significant differences from healthy controls. Our findings provide novel evidence of clinically relevant disruptions in the anatomic association of the superior temporal lobe with other regions of whole-brain networks in patients with psychotic disorders, but not in their unaffected relatives, suggesting that it is a disease-related trait. Network disorganization primarily involving frontal lobe and subcortical regions in nonpsychotic relatives may be related to familial illness risk."
722,Hala El-Habashy,"75% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have lower urinary tract symptoms. Moreover, up to 80% of asymptomatic patients show abnormalities on urodynamic examination. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of repetitive magnetic stimulation on the motor cortex versus sacral roots in MS patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). 40 MS patients with LUTD were divided according to urodynamic studies (UDS) into two groups (20 patients each): Group A (overactive bladder) and Group B (underactive bladder). Each group was further subdivided into Subgroup (A-I) and (B-I) which received cortical magnetic stimulation and Subgroup (A-II) and (B-II) which received sacral magnetic stimulation. UDS, pelvic ultrasound as well as Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) questionnaire were compared before and after magnetic stimulation sessions in each group as well as between groups. UDS showed significant reduction in bladder capacity, improvement in bladder contractility in all groups and subgroups. Moreover, it showed improvement of urine flow rate only in Group B. Reduction of post-void residual urine was noted in all subgroups except in (Group A-II). I-QOL questionnaire showed improvement in patients with underactive bladder only. Intergroup comparison between A and B showed no difference. Cortical as well as sacral magnetic stimulation showed significant effect on lower urinary tract dysfunction that led to improvement in symptoms in MS patients with underactive bladder, rather than those with overactive bladder."
523,Stanislav Rodkin,"Neuron and glia death after axon transection is regulated by various signaling proteins. Protein p53 is a key regulator of diverse cell functions including stress response, DNA repair, proliferation, and apoptosis. We showed that p53 was overexpressed in crayfish ganglia after bilateral axotomy. In the isolated crayfish stretch receptor, a simple natural neuroglial preparation, which consists of a single mechanoreceptor neuron (MRN) enveloped by glial cells, p53 regulated axotomy-induced death of glial cells remote from the axon transection site. In MRN, p53 immunofluorescence was highest in the nucleolus and in the narrow cytoplasmic ring around the nucleus; its levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm were lower. After axotomy, p53 accumulated in the neuronal perikaryon. Its immunofluorescence also increased in the neuronal and glial nuclei. However, p53 immunofluorescence in the most of neuronal nucleoli disappeared. Axotomy-induced apoptosis of remote glial cells increased in the presence of p53 activators WR-1065 and nutlin-3 but reduced by pifithrin-α that inhibits transcriptional activity of p53. Pifithrin-μ that inhibits p53 effect on mitochondria increased axotomy-induced apoptosis of remote glial cells but reduced their necrosis. Therefore, axotomy-induced apoptosis of remote glial cells was associated with p53 effect on transcription processes, whereas glial necrosis was rather associated with transcription-independent p53 effect on mitochondria. Apparently, the fate of remote glial cells in the axotomized crayfish stretch receptor is determined by the balance between different modalities of p53 activity."
878,Shan Lin,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited neuropathy. Although new causative and disease-associated genes have been identified for CMT2 in recent years, molecular diagnoses are still lacking for a majority of patients. We here studied a cohort of 35 CMT2 patients of Chinese descent, using whole exome sequencing to investigate gene mutations and then explored relationships among genotypes, clinical features, and mitochondrial DNA levels in blood as assessed by droplet digital PCR. We identified pathogenic variants in 57% of CMT2 patients. The most common genetic causes in the cohort were MFN2 mutations. Two patients with typical CMT phenotype and neuromyotonia were detected to harbor compound heterozygous variations in the HINT1 gene. In conclusion, our work supports that the molecular diagnostic rate of CMT2 patients can be increased via whole exome sequencing, and our data suggest that assessment of possible HINT1 mutations should be undertaken for CMT2 patients with neuromyotonia."
112,Bethany A Freel,"Discerning the underlying pathological mechanisms and the identification of therapeutic strategies to treat individuals affected with rare neurological diseases has proven challenging due to a host of factors. For instance, rare diseases affecting the nervous system are inherently lacking in appropriate patient sample availability compared to more common diseases, while animal models often do not accurately recapitulate specific disease phenotypes. These challenges impede research that may otherwise illuminate aspects of disease initiation and progression, leading to the ultimate identification of potential therapeutics. The establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a human cellular model with defined genetics has provided the unique opportunity to study rare diseases within a controlled environment. iPSC models enable researchers to define mutational effects on specific cell types and signaling pathways within increasingly complex systems. Among rare diseases, pediatric diseases affecting neurodevelopment and neurological function highlight the critical need for iPSC-based disease modeling due to the inherent difficulty associated with collecting human neural tissue and the complexity of the mammalian nervous system. Rare neurodevelopmental disorders are therefore ideal candidates for utilization of iPSC-based in vitro studies. In this review, we address both the state of the iPSC field in the context of their utility and limitations for neurodevelopmental studies, as well as speculating about the future applications and unmet uses for iPSCs in rare diseases."
741,Megan M Niedzwiecki,"BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder with contributions from genetic and environmental factors. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) has the potential to identify novel endogenous and environmental factors involved in AD. Previous metabolomics studies have identified circulating metabolites linked to AD, but lack of replication and inconsistent diagnostic algorithms have hindered the generalizability of these findings. Here we applied HRM to identify plasma metabolic and environmental factors associated with AD in two study samples, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD incorporated to achieve high diagnostic accuracy.


METHODS
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based HRM was used to identify plasma and CSF metabolites associated with AD diagnosis and CSF AD biomarkers in two studies of prevalent AD (Study 1: 43 AD cases, 45 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] cases, 41 controls; Study 2: 50 AD cases, 18 controls). AD-associated metabolites were identified using a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) framework.


RESULTS
An MWAS meta-analysis identified three non-medication AD-associated metabolites in plasma, including elevated levels of glutamine and an unknown halogenated compound and lower levels of piperine, a dietary alkaloid. The non-medication metabolites were correlated with CSF AD biomarkers, and glutamine and the unknown halogenated compound were also detected in CSF. Furthermore, in Study 1, the unknown compound and piperine were altered in MCI patients in the same direction as AD dementia.


CONCLUSIONS
In plasma, AD was reproducibly associated with elevated levels of glutamine and a halogen-containing compound and reduced levels of piperine. These findings provide further evidence that exposures and behavior may modify AD risks."
647,Elisabetta C Del Re,"Background. Abnormalities of mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential, indexing preattentive mechanisms, are consistently reported in schizophrenia (SZ). MMN abnormalities elicited to different deviant types have been recently shown to distinguish among patients according to length of their illness as well as inpatient versus outpatient status, and to be modulated by premorbid IQ. The objective of this study was to evaluate the MMN elicited by both frequency and duration deviant stimuli in patients with early schizophrenia (EP) recruited from an outpatient clinic in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods. Twenty-two healthy controls (HC) and 22 age-, handedness-, and gender-matched EP were tested using a frequency and duration MMN paradigm. Clinical data were also collected. Results. Frequency MMN amplitude but not duration MMN was significantly reduced in EP relative to HC subjects (P = .015). Conclusions. These results indicate that in this sample of early psychosis outpatient group, reductions in frequency MMN but not in duration MMN index clinical status. The relationship between age at first hospitalization and MMN frequency and duration amplitude and latency indicates that neurodevelopmental stage, auditory function, and clinical status are tightly linked."
196,Francisco Donoso,"BACKGROUND
Polyphenols are phytochemicals that have been associated with therapeutic effects in stress-related disorders. Indeed, studies suggest that polyphenols exert significant neuroprotection against multiple neuronal injuries, including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, but the mechanisms are unclear. Evidence indicates that polyphenol neuroprotection may be mediated by activation of Nrf2, a transcription factor associated with antioxidant and cell survival responses. On the other hand, in stress-linked disorders, Fkbp5 is a novel molecular target for treatment because of its capacity to regulate glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. However, it is not clear the role Fkbp5 plays in polyphenol-mediated stress modulation. In this study, the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of the naturally derived polyphenols xanthohumol and quercetin against cytotoxicity induced by corticosterone were investigated in primary cortical cells.


METHODS
Primary cortical cells containing both neurons and astrocytes were pre-incubated with different concentrations of quercetin and xanthohumol to examine the neuroprotective effects of polyphenols on cell viability, morphology, and gene expression following corticosterone insult.


RESULTS
Both polyphenols tested prevented the reduction of cell viability and alterations of neuronal/astrocytic numbers due to corticosterone exposure. Basal levels of Bdnf mRNA were also decreased after corticosterone insult; however, this was reversed by both polyphenol treatments. Interestingly, the Nrf2 inhibitor blocked xanthohumol but not quercetin-mediated neuroprotection. In contrast, we found that Fkbp5 expression is exclusively modulated by quercetin.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that naturally derived polyphenols protect cortical cells against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity and enhance cell survival via modulation of the Nrf2 pathway and expression of Fkbp5."
765,Minghui Hua,"BACKGROUND
Numerous neuroimaging studies have revealed that schizophrenia was characterized by wide-spread dysconnection among brain regions during rest measured by functional connectivity (FC). In contrast with FC, effective connectivity (EC) provides information about directionality of brain connections and is thus valuable in mechanistic investigation of schizophrenic brain. However, a systematic characterization of whole-brain resting-state EC (rsEC) and how it captures different information compared with resting-state FC (rsFC) in schizophrenia are still lacking.


AIMS
To systematically characterize the abnormalities of rsEC, compared with rsFC, in schizophrenia, and to test its discriminative power as a neuroimaging marker for schizophrenia diagnosis.


METHOD
Whole-brain rsEC and rsFC networks were constructed using resting-state fMRI data and compared between 103 patients with schizophrenia and 110 healthy participants. Pattern classifications between patients and controls based on whole-brain rsEC and rsFC were further performed using multivariate pattern analysis.


RESULTS
We identified 17 rsEC significantly disrupted (mostly decreased) in patients, among which all were associated with the thalamus and 15 were from limbic areas (including hippocampus, parahippocampus and cingulate cortex) to the thalamus. In contrast, abnormal rsFC were widely distributed in the whole brain. The classification accuracies for distinguishing patients and controls using whole-brain rsEC and rsFC patterns were 78.6% and 82.7%, respectively, and was further improved to 84.5% when combining rsEC and rsFC.


CONCLUSIONS
Schizophrenia is featured by disrupted 'limbic areas-to-thalamus' rsEC, in contrast with diffusively altered rsFC. Moreover, both rsEC and rsFC contain valuable and complementary information which may be used as diagnostic markers for schizophrenia."
462,Jadier Redondo Cotes,"Ubiquitination is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory, but the involvement of HECT E3 ligases in these processes has not yet been established. Here, we bilaterally infused heclin, a specific inhibitor of these ligases, into the dorsal hippocampus of male Wistar rats that were trained in a contextual fear conditioning. Heclin improved short-term memory, consolidation, retrieval, and reconsolidation when administered immediately post training, prior to testing, or after memory reactivation, respectively. In addition, it impaired memory extinction when administered prior to a long reactivation session. Heclin infusion was also tested for locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in a circular arena, but no effect was seen. Taken together, these results indicate that HECT E3 ligases are involved in the modulation of fear memory."
819,Porntip Parmontree,"Background Early posttraumatic seizure (PTS) is a significant cause of unfavorable outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study was aimed to investigate the incidence and determine a predictive model for early PTS. Materials and Methods A prospective cohort study of 484 TBI patients was conducted. All patients were evaluated for seizure activities within 7 days after the injury. Risk factors for early PTS were identified using univariate analysis. The candidate risk factors with p < 0.1 were selected into multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of early PTS. The fitting model and the power of discrimination with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were demonstrated. The nomogram for prediction of early PTS was developed for individuals. Results There were 27 patients (5.6%) with early PTS in this study. The final model illustrated chronic alcohol use (odds ratio [OR]: 4.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-10.07), epidural hematoma (OR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.70-9.33), and Glasgow Coma Scale score 3-8 (OR: 3.78, 95% CI: 1.53-9.35) as predictors of early PTS. The AUROC curve was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66-0.87). Conclusions The significant predictors for early PTS were chronic alcohol use, epidural hematoma, and severe TBI. Our nomogram was considered as a reliable source for prediction."
972,Ryuta Matsuoka,"OBJECTIVE
False-positive intraoperative muscle motor evoked potential (mMEP) monitoring results due to systemic effects of anesthetics and physiological changes continue to be a challenging issue. Although control MEPs recorded from the unaffected side are useful for identifying a true-positive signal, there are no muscles on the upper or lower extremities to induce control MEPs in cervical spine surgery. Therefore, this study was conducted to clarify if additional MEPs derived from facial muscles can feasibly serve as controls to reduce false-positive mMEP monitoring results in cervical spine surgery.


METHODS
Patients who underwent cervical spine surgery at the authors' institution who did not experience postoperative neurological deterioration were retrospectively studied. mMEPs were induced with transcranial supramaximal stimulation. Facial MEPs (fMEPs) were subsequently induced with suprathreshold stimulation. The mMEP and subsequently recorded fMEP waveforms were paired during each moment during surgery. The initial pair was regarded as the baseline. A significant decline in mMEP and fMEP amplitude was defined as > 80% and > 50% decline compared with baseline, respectively. All mMEP alarms were considered false positives. Based on 2 different alarm criteria, either mMEP alone or both mMEP and fMEP, rates of false-positive mMEP monitoring results were calculated.


RESULTS
Twenty-three patients were included in this study, corresponding to 102 pairs of mMEPs and fMEPs. This included 23 initial and 79 subsequent pairs. Based on the alarm criterion of mMEP alone, 17 false-positive results (21.5%) were observed. Based on the alarm criterion of both mMEP and fMEP, 5 false-positive results (6.3%) were observed, which was significantly different compared to mMEP alone (difference 15.2%; 95% CI 7.2%-23.1%; p < 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
fMEPs might be used as controls to reduce false-positive mMEP monitoring results in cervical spine surgery."
883,Yu-Ling Liu,"Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, GA), a phenolic acid, is ubiquitous in almost all parts of the plant. In the present study, a neuroinflammatory rat model using intranigral infusion of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 4 μg/μL) was employed to study the neuroprotective effect of GA which was orally administered daily. Compared with the vehicle-treated rats, systemic administration of GA (100 mg/kg) significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein (a biomarker of activated astrocytes) and ED-1 (a biomarker of activated microglia), as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, a proinflammatory enzyme) and interleukin-1β (a proinflammatory cytokine), in the LPS-infused substantia nigra (SN) of rat brain. At the same time, GA attenuated LPS-induced elevation in heme oxygenase-1 level (a redox-regulated protein) and α-synuclein aggregation (a hallmark of CNS neurodegeneration), suggesting that GA is capable of inhibiting LPS-induced oxidative stress and protein conjugation. Furthermore, GA prevented LPS-induced caspase 3 activation (a biomarker of programmed cell death) and LPS-induced increases in receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 and RIPK-3 levels (biomarkers of necroptosis), indicating that GA inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis and necroptosis in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of rat brain. Moreover, an in vitro study was employed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of GA on BV2 microglial cells which were subjected to LPS (1 μg/mL) treatment. Consistently, co-incubation of GA diminished LPS-induced increases in iNOS mRNA and iNOS protein expression in the treated BV-2 cells as well as NO production in the culture medium. The anti-oxidative activity of GA was evaluated using iron-induced lipid peroxidation of brain homogenates. After 3-h incubation at 37 °C, GA was more potent than glutathione and less potent than trolox in inhibiting iron-induced lipid peroxidation. Conclusively, the present study suggests that GA is anti-inflammatory via attenuating LPS-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and protein conjugation. Furthermore, GA prevented LPS-induced programmed cell deaths of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of the rat brain, suggesting that GA may be neuroprotective by attenuating neuroinflammation in CNS neurodegenerative diseases."
752,Sara E Keefer,"Environmental cues can become predictors of food availability through Pavlovian conditioning. Two forebrain regions important in this associative learning are the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Recent work showed the BLA-mPFC pathway is activated when a cue reliably signals food, suggesting the BLA informs the mPFC of the cue's value. The current study tested this hypothesis by altering the value of 2 food cues using reversal learning and illness-induced devaluation paradigms. Rats that received unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the BLA and mPFC contralaterally placed, along with ipsilateral and sham controls, underwent discriminative conditioning, followed by reversal learning and then devaluation. All groups successfully discriminated between 2 auditory stimuli that were followed by food delivery (conditional stimulus [CS] +) or not rewarded (CS-), demonstrating this learning does not require BLA-mPFC communication. When the outcomes of the stimuli were reversed, the rats with disconnected BLA-mPFC (contralateral condition) showed increased responding to the CSs, especially to the rCS + (original CS-) during the first session, suggesting impaired cue memory recall and behavioral inhibition compared to the other groups. For devaluation, all groups successfully learned conditioned taste aversion; however, there was no evidence of cue devaluation or differences between groups. Interestingly, at the end of testing, the nondevalued contralateral group was still responding more to the original CS + (rCS-) compared to the devalued contralateral group. These results suggest a potential role for BLA-mPFC communication in guiding appropriate responding during periods of behavioral flexibility when the outcomes, and thus the values, of learned cues are altered.

1005,Kaissar Farah,"INTRODUCTION
Pyogenic spondylodiscitis is a rare disease, but incidence is increasing. Reported failure rates following conservative management range from 12% to 18%. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of posterior percutaneous pedicle screw fixation combined with anterior debridement and fusion (ADF) for infective spondylodiscitis in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine.


METHODS
The retrospective study cohort comprised all patients without neurological deficit who underwent minimally invasive posterior and anterior surgery between April 2008 and April 2016 for thoracic and/or lumbar spondylodiscitis.


RESULTS
Forty patients were eligible (16 female: 40%). The lumbar region was affected in 31 cases (77.5%). Source of infection was identified in only 22 cases (55%) and bacteriological identification was obtained in 32 cases (80%). Mean hospital stay was 14.8 days (range, 6-39 days). Complete recovery was achieved in 39 patients (97.5%) at 3 months' follow-up. Mean preoperative local kyphosis angle was 16.1o, versus 14o at 1-year (p>0.05). 36 patients (90%) had at least 1 year's follow-up, and fusion was obtained for all these cases.


CONCLUSION
Two-stage minimally invasive surgery is effective and safe for the treatment of single or two-level thoracolumbar spondylodiscitis. It could be an alternative to conventional open surgery or conservative treatment."
284,Monika Sivakova,"OBJECTIVES
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) typically affecting young adults. Although the pathogenesis of MS is not fully understood, there is evidence to suggest that inflammation-induced oxidative stress can play a role in demyelination and axonal damage. Oxidative stress also participates in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. Data from large epidemiological studies showed a higher risk of vascular events in MS patients. The aim of our study was to analyse the presence of oxidative stress and its association with the parameters of subclinical atherosclerosis in the early stages of MS.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We compared 13 newly diagnosed MS patients with a group of 13 healthy age- and BMI-matched controls. Blood samples were measured for total antioxidant activity using TEAC assay. Endothelial function, expressed as reperfusion hyperaemia index (RHI) and arterial stiffness, expressed as augmentation index standardized to a pulse of 75/min (AI@75) were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry.


RESULTS
MS patients had significantly lower TEAC compared to controls [0.8 (0.4-2.4) vs. 1.2 (0.6-3.8) mmol/l; p=0.004]. The frequency of increased arterial stiffness (61.6% vs. 30.8%) and endothelial dysfunction (46.2% vs. 38.5%) was comparable in MS patients and in controls. There was no significant association between TEAC, increased arterial stiffness or endothelial dysfunction in patients and controls.


CONCLUSION
Our study showed decreased antioxidant capacity in newly diagnosed MS patients compared to controls. We failed to find association of subclinical atherosclerosis with oxidative stress in newly diagnosed MS."
914,Elisabeth E M Reus,"PURPOSE
The spike-wave index (SWI) is a key feature in the diagnosis of electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. Estimating the SWI manually is time-consuming and is subject to interrater and intrarater variability. Use of automated detection software would save time. Thereby, this software will consistently detect a certain EEG phenomenon as epileptiform and is not influenced by human factors. To determine noninferiority in calculating the SWI, we compared the performance of a commercially available spike detection algorithm (P13 software, Persyst Development Corporation, San Diego, CA) with human expert consensus.


METHODS
The authors identified all prolonged EEG recordings for the diagnosis or follow-up of electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep carried out from January to December 2018 at an epilepsy tertiary referral center. The SWI during the first 10 minutes of sleep was estimated by consensus of two human experts. This was compared with the SWI calculated by the automated spike detection algorithm using the three available sensitivity settings: ""low,"" ""medium,"" and ""high."" In the software, these sensitivity settings are denoted as perception values.


RESULTS
Forty-eight EEG recordings from 44 individuals were analyzed. The SWIs estimated by human experts did not differ from the SWIs calculated by the automated spike detection algorithm in the ""low"" perception mode (P = 0.67). The SWIs calculated in the ""medium"" and ""high"" perception settings were, however, significantly higher than the human expert estimated SWIs (both P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Automated spike detection (P13) is a useful tool in determining SWI, especially when using the ""low"" sensitivity setting. Using such automated detection tools may save time, especially when reviewing larger epochs."
83,Franklin Lima,"BACKGROUND
Surgical access to the second (V2, maxillary) and third (V3, mandibular) branches of the trigeminal nerve (V) has been classically through a transoral approach. Increasing expertise with endoscopic anatomy has achieved less invasive, more efficient access to skull base structures. The authors present a surgical technique using an endoscopic endonasal approach for the treatment of painful V2 neuropathy.


METHODS
Endoscopic endonasal dissections using a transmaxillary approach were performed in four formalin-fixed cadaver heads to expose the V2 branch of the trigeminal nerve. Relevant surgical anatomy was evaluated and anatomic parameters for neurectomy were identified.


RESULTS
Endoscopic endonasal transmaxillary approaches completed bilaterally to the pterygopalatine and pterygomaxillary fossae exposed the V2 branch where it emerged from the foramen rotundum. The anatomy defined for the location of neurectomy was determined to be the point where V2 emerged from the foramen rotundum into the pterygopalatine fossa. The technique was then performed in 3 patients with intractable painful V2 neuropathy.


CONCLUSIONS
In our cadaveric study and clinical cases, the endoscopic endonasal approach to the pterygopalatine fossa achieved effective exposure and treatment of isolated V2 painful neuropathy. Important surgical steps to visualize the maxillary nerve and its branches and key landmarks of the pterygopalatine fossa are discussed. This minimally invasive approach appears to be a valid alternative for select patients with painful V2 trigeminal neuropathy."
717,Zhengmao Li,"Neurodegenerative diseases all share several common features such as involvement of oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in pathogenesis. Oxidative stress induced by overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) or impairment of the antioxidant deficiency results in mitochondrial dysfunction and initiation of the cell death cascade. Berberine (BBR), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to exert anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis effect in CNS diseases. However, the mechanism of BBR on regulating mitophagy and protecting mitochondrial function under oxidative stress remains unclear. In present study, we evaluated the beneficial effects of BBR on the tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we explored the protective role of BBR in mitochondrial function and mitophagy under oxidative stress in PC-12 cells. Our results demonstrated that BBR effectively inhibited t-BHP-induced apoptosis which is associated with the decreased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ROS overproduction. Moreover, BBR significantly suppressed cytochrome c expression, upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction by optimizing mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm) status and ATP production. In addition, BBR reduced the expression of autophagy-specific marker LC3, SQTM1/p62, and maintained lysosome normal function which involved the restoration of upstream signaling pathway AKT and mTOR phosphorylation level. Collectively, these findings suggested that BBR protects PC-12 cells from oxidative injury through inhibiting ROS level, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, which suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress and neurotoxic damages."
1059,Veronica Diaz,"When resources, such as food, territory, and potential mates are limited, competition among animals of the same species is inevitable. Over bouts of agonistic interactions, winners and losers are determined. Losing is a traumatic experience, both physically and psychologically. Losers not only need to deploy a set of species-specific defensive behaviors to minimize the physical damage during defeat, but also adjust their behavior towards the winners to avoid future fights in which they are likely disadvantaged. The expression of defensive behaviors and the fast and long-lasting changes in behaviors accompanying defeat must be supported by a complex neural circuit. This review summarizes the brain regions that have been implicated in coping with social defeat, one centered on basolateral amygdala and the other on ventromedial hypothalamus. Gaps in our knowledge and hypotheses that may help guide future experiments are also discussed."
297,Svetlana Kvint,"In this report, we describe an extremely rare case of a giant pseudoaneurysm of the internal iliac artery causing marked destructive changes at a disc space and mimicking discitis-osteomyelitis. Only two other cases of pseudoaneurysms extending into the disc space have been reported, and those arose from the aorta and were relatively straightforward to diagnose. Our case is unique because the pseudoaneurysm arose from the internal iliac artery, an artery that is not usually included in the field of view of lumbar MRIs or CT. However, the pseudoaneurysm was so large that it extended to the lumbosacral junction, where it eroded a disc space and caused findings of discitis-osteomyelitis. Complex paraspinal fluid collections causing osseous erosions should raise the possibility of an aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm. CT or conventional angiography should be considered if the question of a vascular mass/collection cannot be answered on conventional cross sectional imaging, as inadvertent biopsy of a pseudoaneurysm can cause catastrophic bleeding."
590,Jessica Oschwald,"Age-related differences in white matter (WM) microstructure have been linked to lower performance in tasks of processing speed in healthy older individuals. However, only few studies have examined this link in a longitudinal setting. These investigations have been limited to the correlation of simultaneous changes in WM microstructure and processing speed. Still little is known about the nature of age-related changes in WM microstructure, i.e., regionally distinct vs. global changes. In the present study, we addressed these open questions by exploring whether previous changes in WM microstructure were related to subsequent changes in processing speed: (a) 1 year later; or (b) 2 years later. Furthermore, we investigated whether age-related changes in WM microstructure were regionally specific or global. We used data from four occasions (covering 4 years) of the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project (N = 232; age range at baseline = 64-86). As a measure of WM microstructure, we used mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 10 major WM tracts averaged across hemispheres. Processing speed was measured with four cognitive tasks. Statistical analyses were conducted with bivariate latent change score (LCS) models. We found, for the first time, evidence for lagged couplings between preceding changes in FA and subsequent changes in processing speed 2 years, but not 1 year later in some of the WM tracts (anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus). Our results supported the notion that FA changes were different between regional WM tracts rather than globally shared, with some tracts showing mean declines in FA, and others remaining relatively stable across 4 years."
1098,Naomi Tistarelli,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide, and also the recognition of its persistence into adulthood is increasing. While ADHD in childhood is highly heritable and mostly driven by familial factors, during adulthood it appears to show a lower heritability, even if there is not total agreement on this yet. This disorder often co-occurs with many other conditions, which also vary across the different stages of development, and several studies have used the twin design to investigate these comorbidities, giving valuable insights into the origins of the observed co-occurrence. This review aims to summarize the main results of twin research, according to the following domains: individual traits, cognitive impairment, behavioral manifestations, clinical conditions and psychosocial risk factors. Individual features seem to play a role in this symptomatology and include personality traits such as negative emotionality, personality disorders and temperamental dimensions with a predominance of novelty seeking. At a lower level, ADHD is associated with both functional and anatomic brain characteristics. ADHD is also associated with some forms of cognitive impairment, such as sluggish cognitive tempo, and learning disabilities, with a specific predisposition to reading disability. In addition, ADHD is strongly associated with externalizing disorders such as conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, and some behavioral outcomes, particularly substance use and abuse both in adolescence and adulthood. Moreover, ADHD symptoms often overlap with other psychological disorders, namely affective and internalizing disorders, as well as autism spectrum disorder and autistic-like traits in a wider sense. Notably, a genetic overlap has been found between asthma and ADHD, particularly with respect to hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions. ADHD also appears to represent a risk factor for disordered eating, and, more specifically, for binge eating and bulimia nervosa. Finally, among psychosocial factors, an association has been proposed between childhood maltreatment and ADHD symptoms."
32,Ruiqi Chen,"OBJECTIVE
Seizures are common complications following intracranial aneurysms and present a greater risk to pediatric patients than adults. Though the risk factors of seizures in adults with intracranial aneurysms have been well documented, the risk factors in pediatric patients remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for preoperative seizures and the effect of the treatment approach on postoperative seizures in pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The data of 64 pediatric patients (mean age 11.4 ± 5.7 years; 68.8 % of males) with intracranial aneurysms were retrospectively analyzed from January 2012 to April 2017. Comparisons were made between patients with preoperative seizures (case group) and those without (control group).


RESULTS
Twenty-four patients (37.5 %) had preoperative seizures, and 15 patients (23.4 %) had postoperative seizures. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age (0-5 years), head trauma history, ruptured aneurysms, lobe hematomas, modified Fisher grade 3-4, giant aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and distal arterial aneurysms were independently associated with the increased risk of preoperative seizures. Patients in the surgical and endovascular groups did not differ significantly in the rates of preoperative seizures or early postoperative seizures (within 1 month) (P > 0.05). However, a significantly lower incidence of late postoperative seizures (1-3 months and 3-6 months) was observed in the surgical group compared with the endovascular group (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms are at high risk for seizures. Risk factors for preoperative seizures included younger age (0-5 years), head trauma history, lobe hematomas, modified Fisher grade 3-4, giant aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and distal arterial aneurysms. Compared with the endovascular treatment, surgical intervention provided more benefits with regard to reducing the risk of late postoperative seizures."
894,Lih-Fen Lue,"New super-sensitive biomarker assay platforms for measuring Alzheimer's disease (AD) core pathological markers in plasma have recently been developed and tested. Research findings from these technologies offer promising evidence for identifying the earliest stages of AD and correlating them with brain pathological progression. Here, we review findings using immunomagnetic reduction, one of these ultrasensitive technologies. The principles, technology and assays developed, along with selected published findings will be discussed. The major findings from this technology were significant increases of amyloid beta (Aβ) 42 and total tau (t-tau) levels in subjects clinically diagnosed with early AD when compared with cognitively normal control (NC) subjects. The composite marker of the product of Aβ42 and t-tau discriminated subjects with early AD from NC subjects with high accuracy. The potential of this technology for the purpose of early or preclinical disease stage detection has yet to be explored in subjects who have also been assessed with brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid AD core biomarker measurements."
435,Jerzy B Gajewski,"INTRODUCTION
Different patterns of detrusor overactivity (DO) have been described and included in several standardization terminology documents. However, it is unclear if these different patterns have any clinical significance.


METHODS
This is a report of the proceedings of Proposal 3: ""Are there different patterns of detrusor overactivity which are clinically relevant?"" from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICIRS) meeting, which took place from 14 to 16 June 2018, in Bristol, UK.


RESULTS
We have collected and discussed, as a committee, the evidence about different urodynamic (UD) patterns of detrusor overactivity and their potential clinical significance. We reviewed the important previous basic research and clinical studies and compiled summaries. The discussion focused on clinical relevance of different UD patterns of DO and what further research is required.


CONCLUSIONS
There are several UD definitions of patterns of detrusor overactivity, however the clinical relevance of these definitions remains unclear. Future research should concentrate on defining the pattern of DO in relation to clinical diagnosis, gender, age, and treatment outcomes."
339,Emanuele Pick,"Introduction
Empathy, in its affective and cognitive components, is a crucial interpersonal ability. It is broadly studied in the field of psychopathology, whereas its study in the neurodegenerative diseases is relatively recent. Existing literature, though, focused on a reduced subset of considered diseases, which often found a compromise in empathy abilities. Organized knowledge about a more comprehensive set of diseases is lacking.


Method
The present PRISMA systematic review was aimed at collecting the current available literature concerning empathic alterations in adult patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases. It considered the different empathy components, evaluated existing patterns, the impact on patients' lives, and treatment considerations.


Results
Overall, the 32 retrieved studies describe a spread deterioration of empathic abilities in patients, with each disease displaying its own pattern of empathy functioning. Literature in this field is fragmented and of heterogeneous quality, and further studies are warranted to increase evidence of many preliminary results.


Discussion
In conclusion, we highlight the crucial importance of acknowledging empathy deficits in these diseases, showing their repercussion on both patients' and caregivers' quality of life, the establishment of a functional doctor-patient relationship, and the development of efficacious psychological intervention. These clinical approaches can be enriched by the knowledge of the spared abilities of patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases."
219,Chan-Mi Kim,"Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), an indicator of neurovascular processes and metabolic demands, is a common finding in Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about what contributes to CBF deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We examine regional CBF differences in 17 MCI compared with 21 age-matched cognitively healthy older adults. Next, we examined associations between CBF, white matter lesion (WML) volume, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and cortical thickness to better understand whether altered CBF was detectable before other markers and the potential mechanistic underpinnings of CBF deficits in MCI. MCI had significantly reduced CBF, whereas cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation were not affected. Reduced CBF was associated with the WML volume but not associated with other measures. Given the presumed vascular etiology of WML and relative worsening of vascular health in MCI, it may suggest CBF deficits result from early vascular as opposed to metabolic deficits in MCI. These findings may support vascular mechanisms as an underlying component of cognitive impairment."
41,Sho Kojima,"We evaluated the effects of moderate-intensity exercise in improving the decline in cognitive performance induced by a 24-h period of acute sleep deprivation (SD). We hypothesized that the positive effect of exercise is mediated by increased oxygenation (measured using near-infrared spectroscopy) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive performance was measured using the reaction time and interference scores of the Stroop colour and word test, in 12 healthy adults (eight males, 21.1 ± 0.3 years-old), at pre- and post-exercise. Cognitive scores were compared under two conditions: rested wakefulness (RW) and 24-h SD. The exercise consisted of 20-min of ergometer cycling at an intensity of 60 % VO2peak. Oxygenation to the DLPFC increased, at 12 min after exercise onset, compared to the baseline and was maintained until the end of the exercise in both RW and SD conditions (P < 0.01). The change in RT correlated with sleepiness (P < 0.05), with no correlation for the interference score and oxygenation. Taken together, moderate-intensity exercise reverses SD-induced cognitive decline."
965,Steffen R Hage,"Marmoset monkeys are known for their rich vocal repertoire. However, the underlying call production mechanisms remain unclear. By showing that marmoset moneys are capable of interrupting and modulating ongoing vocalizations, recent studies in marmoset monkeys challenged the decades-old concepts of primate vocal pattern generation that suggested that monkey calls consist of one discrete call pattern. The current article will present a revised version of the brainstem vocal pattern-generating network in marmoset monkeys that is capable of responding to perturbing auditory stimuli with rapid modulatory changes of the acoustic call structure during ongoing calls. These audio-vocal integration processes might potentially happen at both the cortical and subcortical brain level."
445,Shin-Ping Kuan,"BACKGROUND
Neuronal cell cultures are widely used in the field of neuroscience. Cell dissociation allows for the isolation of a desired cell type, yet the neuronal complexity that distinguishes the nervous system is often lost as a result. Thus, culturing neural tissues in ex vivo format provides a physiological context that more closely resembles the in vivo environment.


NEW METHOD
We developed a simple method to culture nodose ganglia neurons from neonatal pigs long-term in ex vivo format using an in-house media formulation derived from commercially available components.


RESULTS
Ganglia were cultured for six and twelve months. mRNA expression of nestin was stable across time. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and tachykinin showed statistically insignificant increases and decreases in mRNA expression, respectively. mRNA expression of glia fibrillary acidic protein decreased, whereas myelin basic protein showed no statistically significant differences, over time. Immunofluorescence studies of sectioned ganglia demonstrated neurofilament-positive cell bodies, glia fibrillary acidic protein and myelin basic protein at all time points. A significant decrease in cell nuclei density and fragmented DNA were noted.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)
There are currently no methods that describe short-term or long-term culturing of porcine nodose ganglia. Further, the media formulation we developed is new and not previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
The simple procedure we developed for culturing nodose ganglia will enable both short-term and long-term investigations aimed at understanding peripheral ganglia in vitro. It is also possible that the methods described herein can be applied to other models, different developmental stages, and potentially other neural tissues."
949,Hannah Fuhrer,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) improves early clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke but insights on determinants of long-term outcome after MT treatment are scarce.


METHODS
Data from stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion of a prospective MT registry (01/2014-06/2017) of a large comprehensive stroke center were analyzed regarding clinical outcome between short- (3 months) and long-term (12 months) assessment reflected by a change of modified Rankin scores (∆mRS). Secondary endpoints included favorable long-term outcome (mRS 0-2). Multi-variable regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of outcome changes and favorable outcome at long term.


RESULTS
Of 264 patients included, 42.0% showed a favorable long-term outcome. Longitudinal analysis found that some individuals still improved, but no overall mRS difference between short and long-term follow-up was detected [∆mRS - 0.004 (95% CI - 0.020; 0.013); p = 0.672]. Right hemispheric stroke [∆mRS 0.286 (0.011; 0.561); p = 0.043] and high NIHSS at discharge [∆mRS, 0.039 (0.004; 0.074); p = 0.029] were associated with a longitudinal mRS decline. Favorable long-term outcome was associated with successful recanalization (p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
A significant number of patients with MT experience a favorable long-term outcome. Outcomes remained stable between short- and long-term follow-up, but some individuals may still show improvement beyond short-term rehabilitation. Right hemispheric stroke and clinical stroke severity at hospital discharge may be frail predictors for delayed decline of functional status, whereas successful recanalization remains a positive outcome predictor. Death rarely occurs beyond 3 months after MT treatment."
2,Lisa Marie Haraldseide,"Purpose: To explore if preoperative patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) provides additional prognostic value as a supplement to other preoperatively known clinical factors in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG).Methods: In a prospective explorative study, 114 patients with high-grade glioma were included. The participants completed the generic HRQoL questionnaire EQ-5D 3L, and the disease-specific questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20 1-3 days before surgery. Operating neurosurgeons scored the patient's preoperative functional level by using Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify HRQoL domains that were associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Log-rank tests were used to visualize differences in survival between groups.Results: In addition to preoperative KPS and age, the EORTC QLQ-BN20 subdomains 'seizures' (HR 0.98, p < .006), 'itchy skin' (HR 1.01, p < .036) and 'bladder control' (HR 1.01, p < .023) were statistically significant independent predictors of survival in a multivariate cox model.Conclusions: Our results suggest that in patients with HGG, certain preoperative symptom scales within EORTC QLQ-BN20 may provide additional prognostic information to supplement other clinical prognostic factors. However, further studies are required to validate our findings. Overall the instruments EQ-5D 3L and EORTC QLQ-C30 do not seem to provide much additional valuable prognostic information to already known prognostic factors."
1097,Krishnashis Chatterjee,"The brain consists of a complex network of cells and matrix that is kept cushioned and nourished by multiple types of fluids: cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and interstitial fluid. The movement of these fluids through the tissues has recently gained more attention due to implications in Alzheimer's Disease and glioblastoma. Therefore, methods to study these fluid flows are necessary and timely for the current study of neuroscience. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging have been used clinically and pre-clinically to image flows in healthy and diseased brains. These measurements have been used to both parameterize and validate models of fluid flow both computational and in vitro. Both of these models can elucidate the changes to fluid flow that occur during disease and can assist in linking the compartments of fluid flow with one another, a difficult challenge experimentally. In vitro models, though in limited use with fluid flow, allow the examination of cellular responses to physiological flow. To determine causation, in vivo methods have been developed to manipulate flow, including both physical and pharmacological manipulations, at each point of fluid movement of origination resulting in exciting findings in the preclinical setting. With new targets, such as the brain-draining lymphatics and glymphatic system, fluid flow and tissue drainage within the brain is an exciting and growing research area. In this review, we discuss the methods that currently exist to examine and test hypotheses related to fluid flow in the brain as we attempt to determine its impact on neural function."
67,Susanne J van Veluw,"Paravascular drainage of solutes, including β-amyloid (Aβ), appears to be an important process in brain health and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the major driving force for clearance remains largely unknown. Here we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in awake head-fixed mice to assess the role of spontaneous vasomotion in paravascular clearance. Vasomotion correlated with paravascular clearance of fluorescent dextran from the interstitial fluid. Increasing the amplitude of vasomotion by means of visually evoked vascular responses resulted in increased clearance rates in the visual cortex of awake mice. Evoked vascular reactivity was impaired in mice with CAA, which corresponded to slower clearance rates. Our findings suggest that low-frequency arteriolar oscillations drive drainage of solutes. Targeting naturally occurring vasomotion in patients with CAA or AD may be a promising early therapeutic option for prevention of Aβ accumulation in the brain."
1014,Kevin K Noguchi,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Here we detail how ZIKV infection produces extensive neuropathology in the developing mouse brain and spinal cord of both sexes. Surprisingly, neuropathology differs depending on viral strain with a French Polynesian isolate producing primarily excitotoxicity and a Brazilian isolate being almost exclusively apoptotic but occurring over a prolonged period that is more likely to produce severe hypoplasia. We also show exposure can produce a characteristic pattern of infection that mirrors neuropathology and ultimately results in gross morphological deformities strikingly similar to CZS. This research provides a valuable mouse model mirroring the clinical course of disease that can be used to test potential therapies to improve treatment and gain a better understanding of the disabilities associated with CZS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed Congenital Zika Syndrome. Despite its devastating effects, very little is known about how ZIKV infection produces fetal neuropathology. Here we detail the temporal progression of ZIKV infection in the mouse brain and spinal cord resulting in massive neurodegeneration of infected regions. We also report a ZIKV strain from a region of Brazil with high levels of microcephaly (abnormally small head circumference) produces particularly devastating neuropathology."
708,Salomon Cohen-Cohen,"Endovascular therapy is the primary treatment for the majority of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF). Surgical occlusion is an effective alternative when embolization is not possible. This video demonstrates microsugical occlusion of a right-sided tentorial dAVF in a symptomatic 45-yr-old male. The dAVF was fed directly by meningohypophyseal trunk. Venous drainage was retrograde through the sphenoparietal sinus, superficial sylvian vein, vein of Labee, and transverse sinus. The patient underwent a right-sided pterional craniotomy; the sylvian fissure was widely opened. Subarachoid dissection was performed until a large arterialized draining vein was identified exiting dura subtemporally. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography confirmed the fistulous site and the draining vein was occluded and divided. The patient remained neurologically intact after surgery. Immediate angiography demonstrates complete occlusion of the dAVF. This video demonstrates the surgical access obtained through a transylvian approach for this tentorial dAVF. Occlusion of the draining vein, with or without resection of the fistula, is enough to permanently treat these lesions."
865,Lívia Maria Bolsoni,"Reconsolidation is the return of a memory to a transient state of lability, following memory consolidation, that can occur when memories are evoked. During the process of reconsolidation, memories may be modified by different means, including the administration of drugs, during a period called the ""reconsolidation window"". This process has been widely studied in animals, but human studies are limited and include several methodological pitfalls. Our objective was to conducte a systematic review of the literature that utilizes pharmacological interventions during the process of reconsolidation of aversive memories in humans, with a critical analysis of the methodologies used. Searches were made in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SciELO using the following search terms: (memory) AND (consolidation OR reconsolidation) AND (pharmacological manipulation OR pharmacological intervention). We found 294 references and ten (3.4%) were included in the review, based on preestablished eligibility criteria. All studies were randomized, double-blind clinical trials. The most commonly studied drug was propranolol. Two studies used a protocol involving autobiographical aversive memories, while in the remaining aversive memories were produced in the laboratory. The timing of pharmacological interventions is a controversial issue in the field, as drug activity must occur within the reconsolidation window. The small number of studies and some methodological difficulties of this type of research highlights the need for studies that individually evaluate some of the issues discussed, particularly the timing of pharmacological interventions and the duration of reconsolidation windows."
1007,Woosuk Kim,"In a previous study, we observed the effect of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) on proliferating cells and neuroblasts in the subgranular zone of mouse dentate gyrus. In the present study, we examined the roles of PGAM1 in the HT22 hippocampal cell line and in gerbil hippocampus after H2O2-induced oxidative stress and after ischemia/reperfusion, respectively. Control-PGAM1 and Tat-PGAM1 proteins were synthesized using Tat-1 expression vector since Tat-1 fusion proteins can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cell membranes. We found that transduction of Tat-PGAM1 protein into HT22 cells was dose- and time-dependent. Delivery of the protein to the cytoplasm was confirmed by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Treatment of HT22 cells with Tat-PGAM1 protein showed a concentration-dependent reduction in cell damage and decreased formation of reactive oxygen species after H2O2 exposure. Tat-PGAM1 administration significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced hyperactivity in gerbils at 1 day after ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, a pronounced decrease in neuronal damage and reactive gliosis were observed in the hippocampal CA1 region of the Tat-PGAM1-treated group at 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion compared to that in the vehicle (Tat peptide) or control-PGAM1-treated groups. Administration of Tat-PGAM1 mitigated the changes in ATP content, succinate dehydrogenase activity, pH, and 4-hydroxynonenal levels in the hippocampus at 4 and 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion compared to that in the vehicle-treated group. In addition, administration of Tat-PGAM1 significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced increases of lactate levels in the hippocampus at 15 min and 6 h after ischemia/reperfusion than in the vehicle or control-PGAM1-treated groups. These results suggest that Tat-PGAM1 can be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent neuronal damage from oxidative stress or ischemia."
3,Joenilton Saturnino Cazé Da Silva,"Episodic memory (EM) is a subsystem responsible for storing and evoking information about the ""What"", ""Where"" and ""When"" elements of an event in an integrated way. This capacity depends of structures with hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The effect of aging on some capacities mediated by these areas, such as the influence of the number of objects on the coding of EM, remains unexplored. The present study examined the memory recall capacity of young and older adults in an EM task which used the number of 2, 4 and 6 items associated with specific space-temporal contexts. The young adults showed better performance coefficients than the older adults in all tasks, regardless of the load used, for all questions, except the ""What"" type. The group differences increase with load augmentation, stabilizing from the tasks with 4 items. In short, the EM efficiency, evaluated through What-Where-When Task, depends on the quantity information encoding."
104,R S Duman,"The pathophysiology and treatment of depression has been the focus of intense research and while there is much that remains unknown, modern neurobiological approaches are making progress. This work demonstrates that stress and depression are associated with atrophy of neurons and reduced synaptic connectivity in brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that contribute to depressive behaviors, and conversely that antidepressant treatment can reverse these deficits. The role of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been of particular interest as these factors play a key role in activity dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity. Here we review the literature demonstrating that exposure to stress and depression decreases BDNF expression in the hippocampus and PFC and conversely that antidepressant treatment can up-regulate BDNF in the adult brain and reverse the effects of stress. We then focus on rapid acting antidepressants, particularly the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which produces rapid synaptic and antidepressant behavioral actions that are dependent on activity dependent release of BDNF. This rapid release of BDNF differs from typical monoaminergic agents that require chronic administration to produce a slow induction of BDNF expression, consistent with the time lag for the therapeutic action of these agents. We review evidence that other classes of rapid acting agents also require BDNF release, demonstrating that this is a common, convergent downstream mechanism. Finally, we discuss evidence that the actions of ketamine are also dependent on another growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its complex interplay with BDNF."
942,Matteo Bologna,"Bradykinesia is one of the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonisms. The various clinical aspects related to bradykinesia and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bradykinesia are, however, still unclear. In this article, we review clinical and experimental studies on bradykinesia performed in patients with Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism. We also review studies on animal experiments dealing with pathophysiological aspects of the parkinsonian state. In Parkinson's disease, bradykinesia is characterized by slowness, the reduced amplitude of movement, and sequence effect. These features are also present in atypical parkinsonisms, but the sequence effect is not common. Levodopa therapy improves bradykinesia, but treatment variably affects the bradykinesia features and does not significantly modify the sequence effect. Findings from animal and patients demonstrate the role of the basal ganglia and other interconnected structures, such as the primary motor cortex and cerebellum, as well as the contribution of abnormal sensorimotor processing. Bradykinesia should be interpreted as arising from network dysfunction. A better understanding of bradykinesia pathophysiology will serve as the new starting point for clinical and experimental purposes."
307,Urvashi Singh,"Background: Malignant otitis externa or skull base osteomyelitis arises as a complication of otological infection in immunocompromised individuals, especially elderly diabetics. With increasing awareness of the disease and better diagnostic modalities, there has been an increased reporting of atypical osteomyelitis of skull base (AOSB). Atypical osteomyelitis of skull base is a relatively rare yet an emerging clinical entity that also occurs in immunocompromised elderly individuals, however, in the absence of a pre-existing otological or rhinological infection. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical presentation and treatment protocol followed in patients diagnosed with atypical skull base osteomyelitis.Methods: A retrospective audit of medical records of patients diagnosed with AOSB between 2014 and 2018 was done. Clinical presentation and radiological assessment done prior to intervention was noted. All patients underwent transnasal endoscopic biopsy of tissue from clivus. Histopathological and microbiological profiling of biopsied tissue and treatment protocol followed was noted.Results: A total of 10 patients were included in the study out of which eight were male and two female. Eight patients were known diabetics and one patient had been on chronic oral steroid use. Majority presented with a vague dull aching headache and with one or more cranial nerve (CN) palsy(s). Radiological imaging showed clival involvement for all. All were managed conservatively with appropriate antibiotics. Disease resolution was defined as either complete resolution of symptoms and/or no residual lesion noted on follow-up MRI of skull base.Conclusions: Individuals presenting with non-specific symptoms of headache with CN palsy(s) with no obvious otological/rhinological infections, should raise suspicion of atypical skull base osteomyelitis. Histopathological diagnosis and microbiological assessment are an essential aid in conservative management with higher antibiotics. Patient compliance and long-term follow-up is essential for adequate and complete resolution of disease."
213,Sonia L Bonifacio,"Neonatal neurocritical care is an evolving subsubspecialty whose goal is to implement neuroprotective care strategies, continuous bedside monitoring of neurologic function, and therapies in order to reduce the risk of neurologic injury and improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates who require intensive care. The provision of neonatal neurocritical care requires a culture change across a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in which equal importance is placed on the neurologic care and the cardiorespiratory care of a given patient. It is a multidisciplinary framework of care in which neonatologist and pediatric neurologist come together to address the unique needs of NICU patients whose brains are still developing and are vulnerable to injury. Advances in bedside brain monitoring techniques and the use of therapeutic hypothermia for Hupoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy have accelerated the development of NeuroNICUs across the United States and abroad. Neonatologists, neurologists, neurophysiologists, nurses, and other ancillary members of the team work together to develop guidelines for commonly encountered neurological conditions in the NICU. The use of these guidelines helps provide standardized care across a unit and can reduce morbidity and length of hospital stay."
605,Giorgi Kuchukhidze,"Background: Language function may be reorganized in patients with malformations of cortical development (MCD). This prospective cohort study aimed in assessing language dominance in a large group of patients with MCD and epilepsy using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Sixty-eight patients (40 women) aged 10-73 years (median, 28.0; interquartile range, 19) with MCD and epilepsy underwent 1.5 T MRI and fMRI (word generation task). Single-subject image analysis was performed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM12). Language lateralization indices (LIs) were defined for statistically significantly activated voxels in Broca's and Wernicke's areas using the formula: LI = (V L - V R)/(V L + V R) × 100, where V L and V R were sets of activated voxels on the left and on the right, respectively. Language laterality was considered typical if LI was between +20 and +100 or atypical if LI was between +19 and -100. Results: fMRI signal was elicited in 55 of 68 (81%) patients. In 18 of 55 (33%) patients, language dominance was typical, and in 37 of 55 (67%) patients, atypical (in 68%, right hemispheric; in 32%, bilateral). Language dominance was not influenced by handedness, electroclinical, and imaging features. Conclusions: In this prospective study on a large group of patients with MCD and epilepsy, about two-thirds had atypical language dominance. These results may contribute to assessing risks of postsurgical language deficits and could assist in planning of ""cortical mapping"" with intracranial electrodes in patients who undergo presurgical assessment."
10,George M Opie,"The effects of muscle fatigue are known to be altered in older adults, and age-related changes in the brain are likely to be a contributing factor. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are not known. The aim of the current study was to use transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to investigate age-related changes in cortical excitability with muscle fatigue. In 23 young (mean age ± SD: 22 ± 2 years) and 17 older (mean age ± SD: 68.3 ± 5.6 years) adults, single-pulse TMS-EEG was applied before, during and after the performance of fatiguing, intermittent isometric abduction of the index finger. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) measures of cortical excitability were increased during (estimated mean difference, 123.3%; P < 0.0001) and after (estimated mean difference, 117.5%; P = 0.001) fatigue and this was not different between groups (P > 0.5). For TMS-EEG, the amplitude of the P30 and P180 potentials were unaffected by fatigue in older participants (P > 0.05). In contrast, the amplitude of the N45 potential in older adults was significantly reduced both during (positive cluster: mean voltage difference = 0.7 µV, P < 0.005; negative cluster: mean voltage difference = 0.9 µV, P < 0.0005) and after (mean voltage difference = 0.5 µV, P < 0.005) fatiguing exercise, whereas this response was absent in young participants. These results suggest that performance of maximal intermittent isometric exercise in old but not young adults is associated with modulation of cortical inhibition likely mediated by activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors."
845,Maziar Behbahani,"Background
The number of incidental meningiomas has increased because of the increased availability of neuroimaging. Lack of prospective data on the natural history makes the optimal management unclear. We conducted a 5-year prospective study of incidental meningiomas to identify risk factors for tumor growth.


Methods
Sixty-four of 70 consecutive patients with incidental meningioma were included. Clinical and radiological status was obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. GammaPlan and mixed linear regression modeling were utilized for volumetric analysis with primary endpoint tumor growth.


Results
None of the patients developed tumor-related symptoms during the study period, although 48 (75%) tumors increased (>15%), 13 (20.3%) remained unchanged, and 3 (4.7%) decreased (>15%) in volume. Mean time to growth was 2.2 years (range, 0.5-5.0 years).The growth pattern was quasi-exponential in 26%, linear in 17%, sigmoidal in 35%, parabolic in 17%, and continuous reduction in 5%. There was significant correlation among growth rate, larger baseline tumor volume (P < .001), and age in years (<55 y: 0.10 cm3/y, 55-75 y: 0.24 cm3/y, and >75 y: 0.85 cm3/y).


Conclusion
The majority of meningiomas will eventually grow. However, more than 60% display a self-limiting growth pattern. Our study provides level-2 evidence that asymptomatic tumors can be safely managed utilizing serial imaging until persistent radiological and/or symptomatic growth."

487,Patricia Sulzer,"OBJECTIVES
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) have an increased risk of developing dementia (PDD). As activities of daily living (ADL) impairment is mandatory for the diagnosis of PDD, assessing early signs of instrumental ADL (iADL) dysfunction, especially in PD-MCI, is essential. In PD, self- and caregiver-reported iADL performance is often confounded by motor dysfunction and mood. Objective and time-efficient performance-based measurements are needed to screen for cognitive-related iADL dysfunction. We evaluated the Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living in Mild Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (ETAM) in PD and determined its value for characterizing a subgroup of PD-MCI patients with mild performance-based iADL impairment.


METHODS
Twenty-one cognitively normal PD patients (PD-NC), 24 PD-MCI patients, and 18 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed. Assessments included the ETAM, a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, iADL, mood, and motor measurements.


RESULTS
PD-MCI patients scored significantly lower on the ETAM total score compared to PD-NC patients (p = .002), whereas HC and PD-NC patients did not statistically differ. No HC scored lower than 27 points (diagnostic cutoff for mild iADL impairment); only PD-MCI patients scored below this cutoff (29.2%) suggesting the ETAM is able to characterize a PD-MCI subgroup with early iADL impairment. PD-MCI patients below the cutoff were more impaired in the attention domain (p = .04).


CONCLUSIONS
The ETAM is a potentially valuable clinical assessment, able to detect first signs of iADL dysfunction in PD-MCI. Further studies in larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the prognostic ability for predicting PDD."
784,Claire Leconte,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a chronic pathology, inducing long term deficits that remains understudied in preclinical studies. In this context, exploration, anxiety-like behavior, cognitive flexibility and motor coordination were assessed until 5 and 10 months after an experimental TBI in the adult mouse, using two cohorts. In order to differentiate age, surgery, and remote gray and white matter lesions, three groups, unoperated, sham-operated, and TBI, were studied. TBI induced delayed motor coordination deficits at the pole test, 4.5 months after injury, that could be explained by gray and white matter damages in ipsilateral nigrostriatal structures (striatum, internal capsule) that were spreading to new structures between cohorts, at 5 versus 10 months after the injury. Furthermore, TBI induced an enhanced exploratory behavior during stressful situations (active phase during actimetry test, object exploration in an open field), risk-taking behaviors in the elevated plus maze 5 months after injury, and a cognitive inflexibility in the Barnes maze that persists until 9 months after the injury. These behavioral modifications could be related to the white and gray matter lesions observed in ipsi- and contra-lateral limbic structures (amygdala, hilus/CA4, hypothalamus, external capsule, corpus callosum, cingular cortex) that were spreading to new structures between cohorts, at 5 months versus 10 months after the injury. The present study corroborates clinical findings on TBI, and provides a relevant rodent chronic model which could help validating pharmacological strategies against the chronic consequences of TBI."
327,Federico Pedraja,"Perception and motor control traditionally are studied separately. However, motor activity can serve as a scaffold to shape the sensory flow. This tight link between motor actions and sensing is particularly evident in active sensory systems. Here, we investigate how the weakly electric mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii of undetermined sex structure their sensing and motor behavior while learning a perceptual task. We find systematic adjustments of the motor behavior that correlate with an increased performance. Using a model to compute the electrosensory input, we show that these behavioural adjustments improve the sensory input. As we find low neuronal detection thresholds at the level of medullary electrosensory neurons, it seems that the behavior-driven improvements of the sensory input are highly suitable to overcome the sensory limitations, thereby increasing the sensory range. Our results show that motor control is an active component of sensory learning, demonstrating that a detailed understanding of contribution of motor actions to sensing is needed to understand even seemingly simple behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMotor-guided sensation and perception are intertwined, with motor behavior serving as a scaffold to shape the sensory input. We characterized how the weakly electric mormyrid fish G. petersii, as it learns a perceptual task, restructures its sensorimotor behavior. We find that systematic adjustments of the motor behavior correlate with increased performance and a shift of the animal's sensory attention. Analyzing the afferent electrosensory input shows that a significant gain in information results from these sensorimotor adjustments. Our results show that motor control can be an active component of sensory learning. Researching the sensory corollaries of motor control thus can be crucial to understand sensory sensation and perception under naturalistic conditions."
1092,Daniel Smieja,"Despite early bilateral cochlear implantation, children with congenital deafness do not develop accurate spatial hearing; we thus asked whether auditory brain networks are disrupted in these children. EEG responses were evoked unilaterally and bilaterally in 13 children with normal hearing and 16 children receiving bilateral cochlear implants simultaneously. Active cortical areas were estimated by the Time Restricted Artifact and Coherent source Suppression (TRACS) beamformer and connected cortical areas were identified by measuring coherence between source responses. A whole-brain analysis of theta band coherence revealed the strongest connections between the temporal areas in all conditions at early latencies. Stronger imaginary coherence in activity between the two auditory cortices to bilateral than unilateral input was found in children with normal hearing reflecting facilitation in the auditory network during bilateral hearing. The opposite effect, depressed coherence, was found during bilateral stimulation in children using cochlear implants. Children with cochlear implants also showed a unique auditory network in response to bilateral stimulation which was marked by increased connectivity between occipital and frontal areas. These findings suggest that cortical networks for sound processing are normally facilitated by bilateral input but are disrupted in children who hear through two independent cochlear implants. Efforts to improve hearing in children with congenital deafness must thus include corrections to potential mismatches in bilateral input to support brain development."
886,José Fidel Baizabal-Carvallo,"BACKGROUND
Functional gait disorders (FGDs) are relatively common in patients presenting for evaluation of a functional movement disorder (FMD). The diagnosis and classification of FGDs is complex because patients may have a primary FGD or a FMD interfering with gait.


METHODS
We performed a detailed evaluation of clinical information and video recordings of gait in patients diagnosed with FMDs.


RESULTS
We studied a total of 153 patients with FMDs, 68% females, with a mean age at onset of 36.4 years. A primary FGD was observed in 39.2% of patients; among these patients, 13 (8.5%) had an isolated FGD (a gait disorder without other FMDs). FMDs presented in 34% of patients with otherwise normal gait. Tremor was the most common FMD appearing during gait, but dystonia was the most common FMD interfering with gait. Patients with FGD had a higher frequency of slow-hesitant gait, astasia-abasia, bouncing, wide-based gait and scissoring compared with patients with FMDs occurring during gait. Bouncing gait with knee buckling was more frequently observed in patients with isolated FGD (P = 0.017). Patients with FGDs had a trend for higher frequency of wheelchair dependency (P = 0.073) than those with FMDs interfering with gait.


CONCLUSIONS
Abnormal gait may be observed as a primary FGD or in patients with other FMDs appearing during gait; both conditions are common and may cause disability."
1033,Alice Mado Proverbio,"The neural mechanisms involved in the processing of vocalizations and music were compared, in order to observe possible similarities in the encoding of their emotional content. Positive and negative emotional vocalizations (e.g., laughing, crying) and violin musical stimuli digitally extracted from them were used as stimuli. They shared the melodic profile and main pitch/frequency characteristics. Participants listened to vocalizations or music while detecting rare auditory targets (bird tweeting, or piano's arpeggios). EEG was recorded from 128 sites. P2, N400 and Late positivity responses of ERPs were analyzed. P2 peak was earlier in response to vocalizations, while P2 amplitude was larger to positive than negative stimuli. N400 was greater to negative than positive stimuli. LP was greater to vocalizations than music and to positive than negative stimuli. Source modeling using swLORETA suggested that, among N400 generators, the left middle temporal gyrus and the right uncus responded to both music and vocalizations, and more to negative than positive stimuli. The right parahippocampal region of the limbic lobe and the right cingulate cortex were active during music listening, while the left superior temporal cortex only responded to human vocalizations. Negative stimuli always activated the right middle temporal gyrus, whereas positively-valenced stimuli always activated the inferior frontal cortex. The processing of emotional vocalizations and music seemed to involve common neural mechanisms. Notation obtained from acoustic signals showed how emotionally negative stimuli tended to be in Minor key, and positive stimuli in Major key, thus shedding some lights on the brain ability to understand music."
693,Ella Gabitov,"Recently, an increasing interest in investigating interactions between brain regions using functional connectivity (FC) methods has shifted the initial focus of cognitive neuroimaging research from localizing functional circuits based on task activation to mapping brain networks based on intrinsic FC dynamics. Leveraging the advantages of the latter approach, it has been shown that despite primarily invariant intrinsic organization of the large-scale functional networks, interactions between and within these networks significantly differ between various behavioral and cognitive states. These differences presumably indicate transient reconfiguration of functional connections-an instantaneous process that flexibly mediates and calibrates human behavior according to momentary demands of the environment. Nevertheless, the specificity of these reconfigured FC patterns to the task at hand and their relevance to adaptive processes during learning remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated (1) to what extent FC within the somatomotor network is reconfigured during motor skill practice, and (2) how these changes are related to learning. We applied a seed-driven FC approach to data collected during a continuous task-free condition, so-called resting state, and during a motor sequence learning task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the task, participants repeatedly performed a short five-element sequence with their non-dominant (left) hand. As predicted, such unimanual sequence production was associated with lateralized activation of the right somatomotor cortex (SMC). Using this ""active"" region as a seed, here we show that unimanual performance of the motor sequence relies on functional segregation between the two SMC and selective integration between the ""active"" SMC and supplementary motor area. Whereas, greater segregation between the two SMC was associated with gains in performance rate, greater segregation within the ""active"" SMC itself was associated with more consistent performance by the end of training. Nether the resting-state FC patterns within the somatomotor network nor their relative modulation by the task state predicted these behavioral benefits of learning. Our results suggest that task-induced FC changes reflect reconfiguration of the connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network rather than a simple amplification or silencing of its intrinsic dynamics. Such reconfiguration not only supports motor behavior but may also predict learning."
877,Claudia Corti,"PURPOSE
Effects of tumor location on cognitive performance of patients with brain tumor are controversial: some studies reported higher risks related to supratentorial locations, some to infratentorial locations, and still others did not find any differences. We aimed to address this issue by comparing school-aged children with supratentorial or infratentorial tumor with respect not only to cognitive outcomes but also to the associations between core cognitive domains and academic abilities.


METHODS
32 children with infratentorial tumor and 22 with supratentorial tumor participated in the study. To detect relationships among cognitive domains, we tested which neuropsychological variable(s) predicted academic skills, controlling for the effects of radiotherapy and time since diagnosis.


RESULTS
Radiotherapy and time since diagnosis, but not tumor location, predicted cognitive outcomes. Radiotherapy negatively influenced attention and executive functioning, as well as reading speed and arithmetic operations accuracy. Unexpectedly, longer time since diagnosis was associated with improvement in attention and reading speed. Tumor location showed an effect on the relationships between core cognitive domains and academic skills: verbal and visual-spatial memory influenced reading and mathematical performance in supratentorial patients; in infratentorial patients, an only effect of visual-spatial memory on mathematical performance was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
Tumor location seems not to influence cognitive performance, while radiotherapy constitutes a key risk factor for cognitive impairment. Attentional and reading abilities may improve over time, possibly due to the weakening of cancer care effects. Different patterns of cognitive associations seem to characterize supratentorial and infratentorial patients, probably associated with different neuroplastic reorganization processes after tumor occurrence."
249,Yuanbin Ru,"OBJECTIVE
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease) is a rare, progressive, fatal neurodegenerative pediatric disorder resulting from deficiencies of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 that are caused by mutations in TPP1. Identifying biomarkers of CLN2 disease progression will be important in assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for this disorder. Neurofilament light is an intrinsic component of healthy neurons; elevated circulating extracellular neurofilament light is a biomarker of neuropathology in several adult-onset neurological diseases. Our objective was to assess whether circulating neurofilament light is a biomarker that is responsive to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in CLN2 disease.


METHODS
Using an ultrasensitive immunoassay, we assessed plasma neurofilament light changes during disease progression in a canine model of CLN2 disease and in ERT clinical trial CLN2 disease patients.


RESULTS
In tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1)-null dogs (N = 11), but not in control dogs [N = 6 (TPP1+/- ) and N = 27 (WT)], neurofilament light levels increased more than tenfold above initial low baseline levels during disease progression. Before treatment in 21 human subjects with CLN2 disease (age range: 1.72-6.85 years), neurofilament light levels were 48-fold higher (P < 0.001) than in 7 pediatric controls (age range: 8-11 years). Pretreatment neurofilament light did not significantly correlate with disease severity or age. In CLN2 disease subjects receiving ERT, neurofilament light levels decreased by 50% each year over more than 3 years of treatment.


INTERPRETATION
Our data indicate that circulating neurofilament light is a treatment-responsive biomarker in CLN2 disease and could contribute to understanding of the pathophysiology of this devastating pediatric disorder."
673,Ruth Peters,"OBJECTIVE
High blood pressure is one of the main modifiable risk factors for dementia. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the best antihypertensive class for optimizing cognition. Our objective was to determine whether any particular antihypertensive class was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline or dementia using comprehensive meta-analysis including reanalysis of original participant data.


METHODS
To identify suitable studies, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO and preexisting study consortia were searched from inception to December 2017. Authors of prospective longitudinal human studies or trials of antihypertensives were contacted for data sharing and collaboration. Outcome measures were incident dementia or incident cognitive decline (classified using the reliable change index method). Data were separated into mid and late-life (>65 years) and each antihypertensive class was compared to no treatment and to treatment with other antihypertensives. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data.


RESULTS
Over 50,000 participants from 27 studies were included. Among those aged >65 years, with the exception of diuretics, we found no relationship by class with incident cognitive decline or dementia. Diuretic use was suggestive of benefit in some analyses but results were not consistent across follow-up time, comparator group, and outcome. Limited data precluded meaningful analyses in those ≤65 years of age.


CONCLUSION
Our findings, drawn from the current evidence base, support clinical freedom in the selection of antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals.

The review was registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42016045454."
1089,Ruth A Shaffer,"EndelTulving (1985) drew a distinction between Remembering and Knowing, spurring a great deal of research on the memorial experiences of recollection and familiarity and their contribution to various phenomena in memory. More recently, studies have used this distinction to situate our understanding of the processes that contribute to the testing effect-or, the benefit of retrieval practice to later memory (see also Tulving, 1967). Using retention intervals of approximately 15 min or less between initial and final testing, several studies have found that initial testing magnifies estimates of recollection but not familiarity, regardless of whether a testing effect is revealed in overall recognition performance (Chan and McDermott, 2007). However, the efficacy of prior testing in enhancing memory has been shown to change over time, as have estimates of recollection and familiarity. Thus, the mechanisms that underlie the quintessential testing effect-one that occurs in overall recognition or recall over longer delays-are still uncertain. To investigate this issue, in two experiments, subjects studied word lists, took 3-letter stem cued-recall tests on half of the studied words, and completed a final recognition test in which estimates of recollection and familiarity were obtained via confidence (Experiment 1) or Remember-Know-New (Experiment 2) judgments. Critically, final recognition tests occurred either immediately, 1 day (Experiment 1 only), or 4 days after initial learning. At all retention intervals and in both methods of estimating recollection and familiarity on the final test (i.e. receiver-operating characteristic and remember-know analyses), initial testing magnified estimates of both recollection and familiarity. These findings suggest that the testing effect can result from changes in both processes and pose issues for theories of the testing effect that consider an exclusive role for recollection."
19,Sandra Dörrenbächer,"Cognitive control is supported by a dynamic interplay of transient brain activation across fronto-parietal networks and sustained activation across fronto-striatal networks. Older adults show disturbances in this dynamic functional recruitment. There is evidence suggesting that cognitive-control training may enable older adults to redistribute their brain activation across cortical and subcortical networks, which in turn can limit behavioral impairments. However, previous studies have only focused on spatial rather than on temporal aspects of changes in brain activation. In the present study, we examined training-related functional plasticity in old age by applying a hybrid fMRI design that sensitively tracks the spatio-temporal interactions underlying brain-activation changes. Fifty healthy seniors were assigned to a task-shifting training or an active-control group and their pretest/posttest activation-change maps were compared against 25 untrained younger adults. After training, older adults showed the same performance as untrained young adults. Compared to the control group, task-shifting training promoted proactive changes in transient mechanisms supporting the maintenance and biasing of task-set representations in a specific prefrontal circuitry; reactive changes in transient mechanisms supporting response-selection processes in dissociable fronto-parietal networks; overall reductions of sustained activation in striatal circuits. Results highlight the importance of spatio-temporal interactions in training-induced neural changes in age."
384,Kanchan Vats,"Studies from our lab demonstrated that 1 × 105 intra-arterial mesenchymal stem cells (IA MSCs) at 6 h following ischemic stroke are efficacious owing to its maximum homing due to elevated stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1) in the tissue. Further, IA MSCs could abate the infarct progression, improve functional outcome, and decrease expression of calcineurin by modifying neuronal Ca2+ channels following ischemic stroke. Since stroke pathology also encompasses acidosis that worsens the condition; hence, the role of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in this context could not be overlooked. ASIC1a being the major contributor towards acidosis triggers Ca2+ ions overload which progressively contributes towards exacerbation of neuronal injury following ischemic insult. Inflammasome involvement in ischemic stroke is well reported as activated ASIC1a increases the expression of inflammasome in a pH-dependent manner to trigger inflammatory cascade. Hence, the current study aimed to identify if IA MSCs can decrease the production of inflammasome by attenuating ASIC1a expression to render neuroprotection. Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 1 × 105 MSCs IA at 6 h to check for the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasome in different groups. Inhibition studies were carried out to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that IA MSCs improves functional outcome and oxidative stress parameters, and decreases the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasomes in the cortical brain region after ischemic stroke. This study offers a preliminary evidence of the role of IA MSCs in regulating inflammasome by modulating ASIC1a."
587,Kim M Gruver,"Optogenetics is a state-of-the-art tool for interrogating neural circuits. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells serve as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). To investigate the properties of this synaptic connection, we sought to elicit time-locked single action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. Using optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing Purkinje cells combined with patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices, we determine the photostimulation parameters required to elicit single time-locked action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. We show that axons require longer light pulses than somata do to elicit single action potentials and that Purkinje cell axons are also more susceptible to light perturbations. We then demonstrate that these empirically determined photostimulation parameters elicit time-locked synaptic currents from postsynaptic cells in the DCN. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing optogenetic stimulation conditions to interrogate synaptic connections."
635,Huanxian Liu,"OBJECTIVE
This study aims to further assess the rates and risk factors for relapse in medication overuse headache (MOH) patients in China.


METHODS
The patients were admitted to neurology outpatient clinics at Chinese PLA General Hospital (primarily for headache) and diagnosed with MOH. They responded well to 2 months of preventive treatment and completed a 1-year consultation. General information was collected, including demographic characteristics (age, height, weight, and education level), the clinical features of the headache and the use of pain relievers (type, frequency and duration). Differences in each factor between the group with relapse and the group without relapse were analyzed by the chi-square test or Wilcoxon test. Variables with a p < 0.05 were included as independent variables in nonconditional logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
In total, 129 patients were recruited for this retrospective study. The relapse rate of the MOH patients at the 1-year follow-up was 24.8%. The relapse rate was significantly higher in the patients with migraine (29/97, 29.9%) than in the patients with tension-type headache (3/32, 9.4%) and in the patients with low education levels (middle school or lower; 24/77, 31.6%) than in those with high education levels (high school or higher; 8/52, 15.4%). Nonconditional logistic regression analysis showed that the type of primary headache was an independent risk factor for MOH relapse (OR 3.719, p = 0.044).


CONCLUSIONS
The relapse rate of MOH patients at the 1-year follow-up was 24.8% in China. The type of primary headache is an independent risk factor for MOH relapse, and patients with migraine as the primary headache are more prone to relapse."
485,Coco O Bernard,"OBJECTIVES
Whether mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) sustained by children results in persistent or recurrent symptoms, over and above those experienced by children who solely sustain mild extracranial injuries, remains debated. The current prospective longitudinal case-controlled study aimed to examine the relative influence of injury and noninjury factors on symptoms in preschool and primary school-aged children who sustained an mTBI or mild extracranial injury at least 8 month earlier.


METHODS
Participants were 64 parents of children (31 mTBI, 33 trauma controls) who sustained injury between ages 2 and 12, whose postconcussive symptoms across the first 3-month postinjury have been previously described. The current study assessed postconcussive symptoms at 8 or more months postinjury (M = 24.3, SD = 8.4) and examined a range of injury and noninjury predictive factors.


RESULTS
At or beyond 8-month postinjury, symptom numbers in the mTBI group were comparable with those of the group who sustained mild extracranial injury. Educational attainment of parents (below or above high-school attainment level) was the only predictor of symptoms at follow-up, with preexisting learning difficulties approaching significance as a predictor.


CONCLUSIONS
While our earlier study found that mTBI was associated with symptoms at 3-month postinjury, follow-up at more than 8 months showed mTBI no longer predicted symptom reporting. While mTBI contributes significantly to the presence of symptoms in the first few months postinjury, researchers and healthcare practitioners in this field need to consider the potential impact of noninjury factors on persistent or recurrent symptoms after mTBI."
924,Jay T Rubinstein,"OBJECTIVE
Auditory and vestibular outcomes after placement of a vestibular-cochlear implant in subjects with varying causes of vestibular loss.


STUDY DESIGN
Prospective case study.


SETTING
Tertiary referral center.


PATIENTS
Three human subjects received a vestibular-cochlear implant. Subject 1 had sudden hearing and vestibular loss 10 years before implantation. Subjects 2 and 3 had bilateral Menière's disease with resolution of acute attacks. All subjects had severe-profound deafness in the implanted ear and bilateral vestibular loss.


INTERVENTION
Vestibular-cochlear implant with electrode positions confirmed by CT.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Electrically-evoked vestibular and cochlear compound action potentials (ECAPs), speech perception, and electrically-evoked slow-phase eye velocities.


RESULTS
Subject 1 had no vestibular ECAP, but normal cochlear ECAPs and cochlear implant function. She had minimal eye-movement with vestibular stimulation. Subject 2 had vestibular ECAPs. This subject had the largest eye velocities from electrical stimulation that we have seen in humans, exceeding 100 degrees per second. Her cochlear implant functions normally. Subject 3 had vestibular and cochlear ECAPs, and robust eye-movements and cochlear implant function.


CONCLUSION
The etiology of vestibular loss appears to have a profound impact on sensitivity of vestibular afferents in distinction to cochlear afferents. If this dichotomy is common, it may limit the application of vestibular implants to diagnoses with preserved sensitivity of vestibular afferents. We speculate it is due to differences in topographic organization of Scarpa's versus the spiral ganglion. In two subjects, the second-generation device can produce higher velocity eye movements than seen in the four subjects receiving the first-generation device."
545,Cecilia Lindig-León,"In the face of limited computational resources, bounded rational decision theory predicts that information-processing should be concentrated on actions that make a significant contribution in terms of the utility achieved. Accordingly, information-processing can be simplified by choosing stereotypic actions that lead to satisfactory performance over a range of different inputs rather than choosing a specific action for each input. Such a set of similar inputs with similar action responses would then correspond to an abstraction that can be harnessed with possibly negligible loss in utility, but with potentially considerable savings in information-processing effort. Here we test this prediction in an identification task, where human subjects were asked to estimate the roundness of ellipses varying from a straight line to a perfect circle. Crucially, when reporting their estimates, subjects could choose between three different levels of precision corresponding to three levels of abstraction in a decision-making hierarchy. To induce changes in level selection, we manipulated the information-processing resources available at the perceptual and action stages by varying the difficulty of identifying the stimulus and by enforcing different response times in the action stage. In line with theoretical predictions, we find that subjects adapt their abstraction level depending on the available resources. We compare subjects' behavior to the maximum efficiency predicated by the bounded rational decision-making model and investigate possible sources of inefficiency."
1093,Patrick D Skelton,"Pten, a gene associated with autism spectrum disorder, is an upstream regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase intracellular signaling pathways that mediate extracellular cues to inform cellular development and activity-dependent plasticity. We therefore hypothesized that Pten loss would interfere with activity dependent dendritic growth. We investigated the effects of this interaction on the maturation of retrovirally labeled postnatally generated wild-type and Pten knockout granule neurons in male and female mouse dentate gyrus while using chemogenetics to manipulate the activity of the perforant path afferents. We find that enhancing network activity accelerates the dendritic outgrowth of wild-type, but not Pten knockout, neurons. This was specific to immature neurons during an early developmental window. We also examined synaptic connectivity and physiological measures of neuron maturation. The input resistance, membrane capacitance, dendritic spine morphology, and frequency of spontaneous synaptic events were not differentially altered by activity in wild-type versus Pten knockout neurons. Therefore, Pten and its downstream signaling pathways regulate the activity-dependent sculpting of the dendritic arbor during neuronal maturation."
744,Mahmoud Reza Ashrafi,"Introduction: Leukodystrophies constitute heterogenous group of rare heritable disorders primarily affecting the white matter of central nervous system. These conditions are often under-appreciated among physicians. The first clinical manifestations of leukodystrophies are often nonspecific and can occur in different ages from neonatal to late adulthood periods. The diagnosis is, therefore, challenging in most cases.Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss different aspects of leukodystrophies. The authors used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to provide an extensive update about epidemiology, classifications, pathology, clinical findings, diagnostic tools, and treatments of leukodystrophies. Comprehensive evaluation of clinical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and genetic studies play the key roles in the early diagnosis of individuals with leukodystrophies. No cure is available for most heritable white matter disorders but symptomatic treatments can significantly decrease the burden of events. New genetic methods and stem cell transplantation are also under investigation to further increase the quality and duration of life in affected population.Expert opinion: The improvements in molecular diagnostic tools allow us to identify the meticulous underlying etiology of leukodystrophies and result in higher diagnostic rates, new classifications of leukodystrophies based on genetic information, and replacement of symptomatic managements with more specific targeted therapies.Abbreviations: 4H: Hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia; AAV: Adeno-associated virus; AD: autosomal dominant; AGS: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome; ALSP: Axonal spheroids and pigmented glia; APGBD: Adult polyglucosan body disease; AR: autosomal recessive; ASO: Antisense oligonucleotide therapy; AxD: Alexander disease; BAEP: Brainstem auditory evoked potentials; CAA: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CADASIL: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CARASAL: Cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy; CARASIL: Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CGH: Comparative genomic hybridization; ClC2: Chloride Ion Channel 2; CMTX: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, X-linked; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; CNS: central nervous system; CRISP/Cas9: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9; gRNA: Guide RNA; CTX: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; DSB: Double strand breaks; DTI: Diffusion tensor imaging; FLAIR: Fluid attenuated inversion recovery; GAN: Giant axonal neuropathy; H-ABC: Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum; HBSL: Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity; HCC: Hypomyelination with congenital cataracts; HEMS: Hypomyelination of early myelinated structures; HMG CoA: Hydroxy methylglutaryl CoA; HSCT: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant; iPSC: Induced pluripotent stem cells; KSS: Kearns-Sayre syndrome; L-2-HGA: L-2-hydroxy glutaric aciduria; LBSL: Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate; LCC: Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts; LTBL: Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate; MELAS: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke; MERRF: Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; MLC: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; MLD: metachromatic leukodystrophy; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NCL: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; NGS: Next generation sequencing; ODDD: Oculodentodigital dysplasia; PCWH: Peripheral demyelinating neuropathy-central-dysmyelinating leukodystrophy-Waardenburg syndrome-Hirschprung disease; PMD: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease; PMDL: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease; RNA: Ribonucleic acid; TW: T-weighted; VWM: Vanishing white matter; WES: whole exome sequencing; WGS: whole genome sequencing; X-ALD: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; XLD: X-linked dominant; XLR: X-linked recessive."
624,Jiang Zhu,"There is a growing recognition regarding the importance of pial collateral flow in the protection from impending ischemic stroke both in preclinical and clinical studies. Collateral flow is also a major player in sensory stimulation-based protection from impending ischemic stroke. Doppler optical coherence tomography has been employed to image spatiotemporal patterns of collateral flow within the dorsal branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) as it provides a powerful tool for quantitative in vivo flow parameters imaging (velocity, flux, direction of flow, and radius of imaged branches). It was employed prior to and following dorsal permanent MCA occlusion (pMCAo) in rat models of treatment by protective sensory stimulation, untreated controls, or sham surgery controls. Unexpectedly, following pMCAo in the majority of subjects, some MCA branches continued to show anterograde blood flow patterns over time despite severing of the MCA. Further, in the presence of protective sensory stimulation, the anterograde velocity and flux were stronger and lasted longer than in retrograde flow branches, even within different branches of single subjects, but stimulated retrograde branches showed stronger flow parameters at 24 h. Our study suggests that the spatiotemporal patterns of collateral-based dorsal MCA flow are dynamic and provide a detailed description on the differential effects of protective sensory stimulation."
1081,Tessa S Schoot,"Lithium is the first line therapy of bipolar mood disorder. Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Li-NDI) and lithium nephropathy (Li-NP, i.e., renal insufficiency) are prevalent side effects of lithium therapy, with significant morbidity. The objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of preventive and management strategies for Li-NDI and Li-NP. For this, the PRISMA guideline for systematic reviews was used. Papers on the prevention and/or treatment of Li-NDI or Li-NP, and (influenceable) risk factors for development of Li-NDI or Li-NP were included. We found that the amount of evidence on prevention and treatment of Li-NDI and Li-NP is scarce. To prevent Li-NDI and Li-NP we advise to use a once-daily dosing schedule, target the lowest serum lithium level that is effective and prevent lithium intoxication. We emphasize the importance of monitoring for Li-NDI and Li-NP, as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent further progression and permanent damage. Collaboration between psychiatrist, nephrologist and patients themselves is essential. In patients with Li-NDI and/or Li-NP cessation of lithium therapy and/or switch to another mood stabilizer should be considered. In patients with Li-NDI, off label therapy with amiloride can be useful."
311,Miguel Quintas-Neves,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Recently, primary age-related tauopathy (PART) has been described as a new anatomopathological disorder where NFTs are the main feature in the absence of neuritic plaques. However, since PART has mainly been studied in post-mortem patient brains, not much is known about the clinical or neuroimaging characteristics of PART. Here, we studied the clinical brain imaging characteristics of PART focusing on neuroanatomical vulnerability by applying a previously validated multiregion visual atrophy scale. We analysed 26 cases with confirmed PART with paired clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. In this selected cohort we found that upon correcting for the effect of age, there is increased atrophy in the medial temporal region with increasing Braak staging (r = 0.3937, p = 0.0466). Upon controlling for Braak staging effect, predominantly two regions, anterior temporal (r = 0.3638, p = 0.0677) and medial temporal (r = 0.3836, p = 0.053), show a trend for increased atrophy with increasing age. Moreover, anterior temporal lobe atrophy was associated with decreased semantic memory/language (r = - 0.5823, p = 0.0056; and r = - 0.6371, p = 0.0019, respectively), as was medial temporal lobe atrophy (r = - 0.4445, p = 0.0435). Overall, these findings support that PART is associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy and predominantly affects semantic memory/language. These findings highlight that other factors associated with aging and beyond NFTs could be involved in PART pathophysiology."
266,Ting Lei,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors of class C GPCRs exist as constitutive dimers, which play important roles in activating excitatory synapses of the central nerve system. However, the activation mechanism induced by agonists has not been clarified on experiments. To address the problem, we used microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation couple with protein structure network (PSN) to explore the glutamate-induced activation for the mGluR1 homodimer. The results indicate that the glutamate binding stabilizes not only the closure of venus flytrap domains but also the polar interaction of LB2-LB2, in turn keeping the extracelluar domain in the active state. The activation of the excelluar domain drives transmembrane domains (TMDs) of the two protomers closer and induces aymmetric activation for the TMD domains of the two protomers. One protomer with lower binding affinity to the agonist is activated while the other protomer with higher binding energy is still in the inactive state. The PSN analysis identifies the allostrical regulation-pathway from the ligand-binding pocket in the extracellur domain to the G-protein binding site in the intracellur TMD region, and further reveals that the asymmetric activation is attributed to be a combination of trans-pathway and cis-pathway regulations from the two glumatates, rather than a single activation pathway. These observations could provide valuable molecular information for understanding of the structure and the implication in drug efficacy for the class C GPCR dimers."
879,Hai Xue,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a major complication after extended endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETSS), which is commonly used in the treatment of anterior skull base tumors. Dural suturing and graded reconstruction are promising techniques to further decrease the incidence of postoperative CSF (poCSF) leakage. The effect of continuous dural suturing in endoscopic surgery was investigated in this retrospective study. A total of 79 EETSS patients were included; the procedures were performed for subdural tumor removal by a single endoscopic neurosurgical team. Comparisons were applied between patients who did and did not undergo endoscopic dural suturing after tumor removal. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables that significantly influenced the incidence of poCSF leakage. In all, 79 adult patients developed Esposito's grade 3 intraoperative high-flow CSF leakage. Ten patients (12.7%) experienced poCSF leakage. One of the 36 patients who underwent intraoperative dural suturing developed poCSF leakage, compared with nine of 43 patients who did not undergo dural suturing (p = 0.016). Regression analysis showed that dural suturing could significantly decrease the incidence of poCSF leakage (p = 0.049, OR 0.108, 95% CI 0.013-0.899). Prophylactic lumbar drainage could also help decrease the CSF leakage rate. Dural suturing under endoscopy is a promising and effective method for application in skull base reconstruction after subdural skull base tumor removal. With future progress, lumbar drainage and even nasoseptal flap placement could be replaced in certain groups of patients undergoing EETSS."
214,Mary Dunbar,"Perinatal strokes are a diverse but specific group of focal cerebrovascular injuries that occur early in brain development and affect an estimated 5 million people worldwide. The objective of this review is to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentations, pathophysiology, outcomes, and management for the 6 subtypes of perinatal stroke. Some perinatal strokes are symptomatic in the first days of life, typically with seizures, including neonatal arterial ischemic stroke, neonatal hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The remaining subtypes present in the first year of life or later, usually with motor asymmetry and include arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke, presumed perinatal hemorrhagic stroke, and in utero periventricular venous infarction. The consequences of these injuries include cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and cognitive and behavioral challenges, in addition to the psychosocial impact on families. While there have been significant advances in understanding mechanisms of both injury and recovery, there is still a great deal to learn regarding causation and the optimization of outcomes."
828,K G Ashwath,"Background Since histopathology is available only after surgery, clinical condition and radiological characters of the tumor are important factors on which a clinician counsels the patient of brain tumor to take a decision regarding the management. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of inflammation can be used as a prognostic marker to predict the survival in high-grade gliomas and metastases. We evaluated the utility of NLR as an adjunct tool in predicting the histopathological grade of brain tumors. Materials and Methods One hundred sixteen patients with a diagnosis of brain tumors planned for surgical excision or biopsy were enrolled in the study. NLR was estimated in the preoperative blood sample. Patients were grouped into low- and highgrade brain tumors and their mean NLRs were analyzed. Similar evaluation was carried out between the intra- and extra-axial tumors. Results Mean age of the study group was 40.14 years with 61 males. Seventy-eight patients had low-grade tumor and 38 patients had high-grade tumor. Sixty patients had extra-axial tumors and 56 patients had intra-axial tumors. The mean NLR of low-grade tumors was 1.68 ± 0.53 and that of high-grade tumors was 3.12 ± 0.74. NLR > 2.4 can be used to identify high-grade brain tumors with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 92%, positive predictive value of 82.1%, negative predictive value of 91%, an excellent impact with likelihood ratio (+) of 10.1, and an odds ratio of 54.1. The mean NLR of extra-axial tumors was 1.68 + 0.62 and that of intra-axial tumors was 2.64 ± 0.91. These observations were statistically significant with p -value < 0.05. Conclusions NLR is an easily available and inexpensive marker of systemic inflammation, which varies across different histopathological grades of brain tumors. Mean NLR is higher in high-grade tumors and also intra-axial tumors with a cutoff value of NLR > 2.4 and > 2.0, respectively."
50,Masina Cotroneo,"The term hemiballism-hemichorea refers to a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements, often violent, described as uncontrollable jerking, flinging, flailing or kicking, involving proximal muscles of a limb and it is often associated with lesions in the subthalamic nucleus. In this report, we described three cases of hemiballism-hemichorea as the first manifestation of acute ischemic stroke with lesion in the frontoparietal region on brain MRI and no involvement of the subthalamic nucleus. One patient was treated with thrombolysis and recovered within one hour. The other patients recovered within 48 h from symptoms onset. The impairment of the recently described ""hyperdirect way"", in which the cortical signal reach directly the subthalamic nucleus, may underlie the symptoms. We support, with a clinical point of view, the role of the frontoparietal region in the genesis of the hemiballism-hemichorea. An acute onset of this symptom should lead to think to an acute stroke."
724,Yingyan Wu,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive geriatric disease, which can be one of the leading causes of serious socioeconomic burden in the aging society. Clinical trials suggest that prompt treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease (EPD) may slow down the disease progress and have a better response. Therefore, conducting proteomics study to identify biomarkers for the diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies of EPD is vital. We aimed at identifying distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD by using the database of GSE62283 based on the platform GPL13669 downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the EPD group (n = 103) and the normal control (NC) group (n = 111) were identified by protein-specific t test. Cluster analysis of DEPs was conducted by protein-protein interaction network to detect hub proteins. The hub proteins were then evaluated to determine the distinct biomarkers by principal component analysis, as well as functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Their biological functions were confirmed by gene ontology functional (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment (KEGG). Two biomarkers, mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (MRRF) and ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18), distinguished the EPD samples from the NC samples, and they were regarded as high-confidence distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD. The most significant GO function was protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO: 0004674) and most of DEPs were enriched in ATP binding in molecular function category (GO: 0005524). These results may help in establishing the prompt and accurate diagnosis of EPD and may also contribute to develop mechanism-based treatments."
211,Charbel El Kosseifi,"The new concept of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy is based on the understanding that many genetic epilepsies are associated with developmental impairment as a direct consequence of the genetic mutation, in addition to the effect of the frequent epileptic activity on brain development. As an example, in infants with KCNQ2 or STXBP1 encephalopathy, seizures may be controlled early after onset or cease spontaneously after a few years, but the developmental consequences tend to remain profound. The term ""developmental and epileptic encephalopathy"" expresses the concept that the genetic defect may be responsible for both the epilepsy and adverse development which is crucial to understanding the disease process for both families and clinicians. The increased use of EEG monitoring, neuroimaging, and metabolic and genetic testing in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has greatly improved our understanding of neonatal-onset epilepsies as seen with the syndromes Ohtahara and Early Myoclonic Encephalopathy outlined in the 1970s into distinct etiology-specific electroclinical phenotypes."
231,Robert A McGovern,"BACKGROUND
Technological improvements frequently outpace the publication of randomized, controlled trials in surgical patients. This makes the application of new surgical techniques difficult as surgeons solely use clinical experience to guide changes in their practice.


OBJECTIVE
To quantitatively examine the learning curve of incorporating new technology into a surgical technique and discuss the clinical significance of incorporating this new technology into daily practice. To identify areas of improvement for operative efficiency and safety.


METHODS
A retrospective observational study examining quantitative measures of operative efficiency and safety from 2009 to 2017 in 454 consecutive patients undergoing stereo-electroencephalography depth electrode implantations.


RESULTS
The transition to a new robotic technique significantly improved operative times (196 min [95% CI 173-219] vs 115 min [95% CI 111-118], P < .0001). Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis demonstrated that mastery of the robotic technique took much longer than the frame-based technique (operative time peak at case 75 vs case 25, plateau of 150 vs 10 cases). Although hemorrhage rates using different vascular imaging techniques did not appear to differ using traditional statistical analysis (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI 22.3%, computed tomography angiography, CTA 17.9%, angiogram 18.1%, likelihood ratio χ2 = 4.84, P = .30), CUSUM analysis suggested MRI as the vascular imaging modality leading to higher hemorrhage and symptomatic hemorrhage rates at our center.


CONCLUSION
This experience demonstrates an improvement in operative efficiency through a series of changes made using clinical experience and intuition while transitioning to a completely new paradigm. CUSUM analysis identified potential areas for improvement in both operative efficiency and safety if used in a prospective manner."
758,Eun Joo Chung,"OBJECTIVE
The Korean patient with Perry syndrome (PS) was the first to come to autopsy. We report a pathologically confirmed patient with PS, and compare to pathological findings of previous literatures.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The patient had a family history of parkinsonism and had a mutation in the <i>DCTN1</i> gene. After death an autopsy was performed. We analyzed macroscopic and microscopic findings of the patient.


RESULTS
There was no prominent cortical atrophy, but microscopy showed severe neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and gliosis in the substantia nigra (SN). We identified transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in surviving SN neurons. In addition, some neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were also seen in the parahippocampal gyrus.


CONCLUSION
The neuropathology, including TDP-43 proteinopathy, is comparable to that reported previously in Caucasian populations. In addition to the stereotypic features of PS, our patient had NFTs in the parahippocampal gyrus, the pathology similar to that is described as primary age-related tauopathy (PART). These observations suggest that comorbid age-related neuropathologic change may also contribute to cognitive impairment in PS. ."
703,Benjamin K Hendricks,"Dissecting aneurysms can pose an immense surgical challenge, and intervention often involves high risk for rerupture because of the volatile nature of the fibrin thrombus overlying the rupture site. This patient presented following rupture of a dissecting aneurysm along the A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The patient underwent a right orbitozygomatic craniotomy, and the aneurysm was approached within the interhemispheric fissure. Manipulation of the aneurysm dome resulted in intraoperative rerupture of the aneurysm, which was controlled by the application of a temporary clip on the parent A2 proximally and distally. Aneurysmectomy of the thin diseased vessel wall was performed. The defect was filled by transecting the frontopolar branch of the ACA and sewing the frontopolar branch onto the aneurysmectomy defect. This provided a suitable patch for the ACA defect. Postprocedural indocyanine green angiography demonstrated patency of the A2 and the anastomosed frontopolar branch. The patient gave informed consent for surgery and video recording. Institutional review board approval was deemed unnecessary.

Postneurosurgical infection (PNSI) is a major problem. Linezolid is a bacteriostatic oxazolidinone antibiotic with a highly activity against Gram-positive cocci resistant to methicillin and a good cerebrospinal fluid penetration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of linezolid in the treatment of PNSI caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS).


Methods
We conducted an observational study for all patients over 14 years old and diagnosed with MRS PNSI. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information were collected prospectively.


Results
A total of 10 patients with PNSI (6 meningitis, 2 ventriculitis, and 2 subdural empyema) received linezolid. MRS isolated was Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases and Staphylococcus epidermidis in three cases. All isolated microorganisms were susceptible to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 2 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC = 1). The rate of microbiologic efficacy was 100% for patients with meningitis or ventriculitis. In the case of subdural empyema, focal infection had improved between 14 and 18 days. No adverse effects occurred during this study.


Conclusion
Our results suggest that linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of PNSI caused by MRS with a high rate of efficacy."
1146,Derek Sayre Andrews,"BACKGROUND
The core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are widely theorized to result from altered brain connectivity. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been a versatile method for investigating underlying microstructural properties of white matter (WM) in ASD. Despite phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity, DWI studies in majority male samples of older children, adolescents, and adults with ASD have largely reported findings of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across several commissural, projection, and association fiber tracts. However, studies in preschool-aged children (i.e., < 30-40 months) suggest individuals with ASD have increased measures of WM FA earlier in development.


METHODS
We analyzed 127 individuals with ASD (85♂, 42♀) and 54 typically developing (TD) controls (42♂, 26♀), aged 25.1-49.6 months. Voxel-wise effects of ASD diagnosis, sex, age, and their interaction on DWI measures of FA, mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) while controlling mean absolute and relative motion.


RESULTS
Compared to TD controls, males and females with ASD had significantly increased measures of FA in eight clusters (threshold-free cluster enhancement p < 0.05) that incorporated several WM tracts including regions of the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculi, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, and corticospinal tract. A diagnosis by sex interaction was observed in measures of AD across six significant clusters incorporating areas of the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus collosum. In these tracts, females with ASD showed increased AD compared to TD females, while males with ASD showed decreased AD compared to TD males.


CONCLUSIONS
The current findings support growing evidence that preschool-aged children with ASD have atypical measures of WM microstructure that appear to differ in directionality from alterations observed in older individuals with the condition. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest sample of preschool-aged females with ASD to be evaluated using DWI. Microstructural differences associated with ASD largely overlapped between sexes. However, differential relationships of AD measures indicate that sex likely modulates ASD neuroanatomical phenotypes. Further longitudinal study is needed to confirm and quantify the developmental relationship of WM structure in ASD."
261,Wan-Li Xiang,"Artificial bee colony (ABC) has a good exploration ability against its exploitation ability. For enhancing its comprehensive performance, we proposed a multistrategy artificial bee colony (ABCVNS for short) based on the variable neighborhood search method. First, a search strategy candidate pool composed of two search strategies, i.e., ABC/best/1 and ABC/rand/1, is proposed and employed in the employed bee phase and onlooker bee phase. Second, we present another search strategy candidate pool which consists of the original random search strategy and the opposition-based learning method. Then, it is used to further balance the exploration and exploitation abilities in the scout bee phase. Last but not least, motivated by the scheme of neighborhood change of variable neighborhood search, a simple yet efficient choice mechanism of search strategies is presented. Subsequently, the effectiveness of ABCVNS is carried out on two test suites composed of fifty-eight problems. Furthermore, comparisons among ABCVNS and several famous methods are also carried out. The related experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of ABCVNS."
933,Irene Aprile,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
After stroke, only 12% of survivors obtain complete upper limb (UL) functional recovery, while in 30% to 60% UL deficits persist. Despite the complexity of the UL, prior robot-mediated therapy research has used only one robot in comparisons to conventional therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of robotic UL treatment using a set of 4 devices, compared with conventional therapy.


METHODS
In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 247 subjects with subacute stroke were assigned either to robotic (using a set of 4 devices) or to conventional treatment, each consisting of 30 sessions. Subjects were evaluated before and after treatment, with follow-up assessment after 3 months. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score. Secondary outcome measures were selected to assess motor function, activities, and participation.


RESULTS
One hundred ninety subjects completed the posttreatment assessment, with a subset (n = 122) returning for follow-up evaluation. Mean FMA score improvement in the robotic group was 8.50 (confidence interval: 6.82 to 10.17), versus 8.57 (confidence interval: 6.97 to 10.18) in the conventional group, with no significant between-groups difference (adjusted mean difference -0.08, P = 0.948). Both groups also had similar change in secondary measures, except for the Motricity Index, with better results for the robotic group (adjusted mean difference 4.42, P = 0.037). At follow-up, subjects continued to improve with no between-groups differences.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Robotic treatment using a set of 4 devices significantly improved UL motor function, activities, and participation in subjects with subacute stroke to the same extent as a similar amount of conventional therapy.

179,Qian Cui,"Previous studies have reported abnormalities in static brain activity and connectivity in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the dynamic patterns of brain connectivity in patients with GAD have not been fully explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic local brain functional connectivity in patients with GAD using dynamic regional phase synchrony (DRePS), a newly developed method for assessing intrinsic dynamic local functional connectivity. Seventy-four patients with GAD and 74 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to the HCs, patients with GAD exhibited decreased DRePS values in the bilateral caudate, left hippocampus, left anterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus extending to inferior temporal gyrus. The DRePS value of the left hippocampus was negatively correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Moreover, these abnormal DRePS patterns could be used to distinguish patients with GAD from HCs in an independent sample (18 patients with GAD and 21 HCs). Our findings provide further evidence on brain dysfunction in GAD from the perspective of the dynamic behaviour of local connections, suggesting that patients with GAD may have an insufficient brain adaptation. This study provides new insights into the neurocognitive mechanism of GAD and could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Future studies on GAD could benefit from combining the DRePS method with task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and non-invasive brain stimulation."
39,Addisu Mesfin,"BACKGROUND
Osteoblastoma is a rare benign aggressive tumor; one third occurring in the spine. The conversion of osteoblastoma to osteosarcoma is uncommon and histologically proven conversion has been rarely reported. The objective of this study is to describe the rare occurrences of spinal osteoblastoma converting to osteosarcoma as well as to provide a literature review.


METHODS
The study design is a case report. Two patients with spinal osteoblastomas recurring and transforming into osteosarcomas are described. The initial presentation, treatment, imaging and histology findings are described.


RESULTS
The outcomes following surgical intervention for histologically diagnosed osteoblastoma with subsequent transformation to osteosarcoma and relative management are described. A literature review of the topic of osteoblastoma converting to osteosarcoma is provided.


CONCLUSION
The rare occurrence of osteoblastoma converting to osteosarcoma imparts several lessons including performing Enneking appropriate surgery for benign aggressive tumors (Enneking 3) as well always performing a biopsy, particularly at the recurrence if imaging is not pathognomonic for a benign primary spine tumor."
866,Jingjing Chang,"The hippocampus is a core brain region that responds to stress. Previous studies have found a dysconnectivity between hippocampus and other brain regions under acute and chronic stress. However, whether and how acute social stress influences the directed connectivity patterns from and to the hippocampus remains unclear. In this study, using a within-subject design and Granger causal analysis (GCA), we investigated the alterations of resting state effective connectivity from and to hippocampal subregions after an acute social stressor (the Trier Social Stress Test). Participants were engaged in stress and control conditions spaced approximately one month apart. Our findings showed that stress altered the information flows in the thalamus-hippocampus-insula/midbrain circuit. The changes in this circuit could also predict with high accuracy the stress and control conditions at the subject level. These hippocampus-related brain networks have been documented to be involved in emotional information processing and storage, as well as habitual responses. We speculate that alterations of the effective connectivity between these brain regions may be associated with the registering and encoding of threatening stimuli under stress. Our investigation of hippocampal functional connectivity at a subregional level may help elucidate the functional neurobiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders."
151,William B Harris,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to perform an individual participant data meta-analysis to identify preoperative factors associated with a good seizure outcome in children with Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) undergoing resective or hemispheric epilepsy surgery.


METHODS
Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched with no language or date restrictions to identify cohort studies of consecutive participants undergoing resective surgery that reported seizure outcomes. The authors recorded all preoperative factors that could plausibly be associated with seizure outcomes and used Cox regression analysis to identify which of these variables were associated with seizure freedom (i.e., Engel class I).


RESULTS
Of 720 citations, 19 articles reporting on 187 participants were eligible. Seizure freedom (Engel class I) was observed in 113 participants (60.4%). On univariate analyses, younger age at disease onset (hazard ratio [HR] 0.906, p = 0.001), younger age at surgery (HR 0.928, p < 0.001), shorter time to surgery (HR 0.921, p = 0.001), and hemispherectomy (HR 0.283, p < 0.001) were all associated with longer time to postoperative seizure recurrence. Additionally, multivariable analysis including the aforementioned variables showed that younger age at surgery (HR 0.946, p = 0.043) and hemispherectomy (HR 0.297, p < 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with a greater time to seizure recurrence and longer duration of seizure freedom.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of pediatric patients undergoing resective or hemispheric surgery for RE achieve good seizure outcome. Although small retrospective cohort studies are inherently prone to bias, the best available evidence utilizing individual participant data suggests hemispheric surgery and younger age at surgery are associated with good seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. Large, multicenter observational studies with long-term follow-up are required to evaluate the risk factors identified in this review."
658,Joshua K Lee,"Relational memory improves during middle childhood and adolescence, yet the neural correlates underlying those improvements are debated. Although memory for spatial, temporal, and other associative relations requires the hippocampus, it is not established whether within-individual changes in hippocampal structure contribute to memory improvements from middle childhood into adolescence. Here, we investigated how structural changes in hippocampal head, body, and tail subregions predict improvements in the capacity to remember item-space, item-time, and item-item relations. Memory for each relation and volumes of hippocampal subregions were assessed longitudinally in 171 participants across 3 time points (Mage at T1 = 9.45 years; Mage at T2 = 10.86 years, Mage at T3 = 12.12 years; comprising 393 behavioral assessments and 362 structural scans). Among older children, volumetric growth in: (a) head and body predicted improvements in item-time memory, (b) head predicted improvements in item-item memory; and (c) right tail predicted improvements in item-space memory. The present research establishes that changes in hippocampal structure are related to improvements in relational memory, and that sub-regional changes in hippocampal volume differentially predict changes in different aspects of relational memory. These findings underscore a division of labor along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus during child development."
967,Emma E Wolters,"BACKGROUND
Off-target [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET binding in the choroid plexus causes spill-in into the nearby hippocampus, which may influence the correlation between [18F]flortaucipir binding and measures of cognition. Previously, we showed that partial volume correction (combination of Van Cittert iterative deconvolution and HYPR denoising; PVC HDH) and manually eroding the hippocampus resulted in a significant decrease of the choroid plexus spill-in. In this study, we compared three different approaches for the quantification of hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir signal using a semi-automated technique, and assessed correlations with cognitive performance across methods.


METHODS
Dynamic 130 min [18F]flortaucipir PET scans were performed in 109 subjects (45 cognitively normal subjects (CN) and 64 mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients. We extracted hippocampal binding potential (BPND) using receptor parametric mapping with cerebellar grey matter as reference region. PVC HDH was performed. Based on our previous study in which we manually eroded 40% ± 10% of voxels of the hippocampus, three hippocampal volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were generated: a non-optimized 100% hippocampal VOI [100%], and combining HDH with eroding a percentage of the highest hippocampus BPND voxels (i.e. lowering spill-in) resulting in optimized 50%[50%HDH] and 40%[40%HDH] hippocampal VOIs. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Rey auditory verbal learning delayed recall. We performed receiver operating characteristic analyses to investigate which method could best discriminate MCI/AD from controls. Subsequently, we performed linear regressions to investigate associations between the hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND VOIs and MMSE/delayed recall adjusted for age, sex and education.


RESULTS
We found higher hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND in MCI/AD patients (BPND100%=0.27±0.15) compared to CN (BPND100%= 0.07±0.13) and all methods showed comparable discriminative effects (AUC100%=0.85[CI=0.78-0.93]; AUC50%HDH=0.84[CI=0.74-0.92]; AUC40%HDH=0.83[CI=0.74-0.92]). Across groups, higher [18F]flortaucipir BPND was related to lower scores on MMSE (standardized β100%=-0.38[CI=-0.57-0.20]; β50%HDH= -0.37[CI=-0.54-0.19]; β40%HDH=-0.35[CI=-0.53-0.17], all p<0.001) and delayed recall (standardized β100%=-0.64[CI=-0.79-0.49]; β50%HDH= -0.61[CI=-0.76-0.46]; β40%HDH=-0.59[CI=-0.75-0.44]; all p<0.001), with comparable effect sizes for all hippocampal VOIs.


CONCLUSIONS
Hippocampal tau load measured with [18F]flortaucipir PET is strongly associated with cognitive function. Both discrimination between diagnostic groups and associations between hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND and memory were comparable for all methods. The non-optimized 100% hippocampal VOI may be sufficient for clinical interpretation. However, proper correction for choroid plexus spillover and may be required in case of smaller effect sizes between subject groups or for longitudinal studies."
593,Li Wang,"Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are considered to be the basis for the decline of motor function; however, the change of effective connections in cortical motor networks that come with aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated the age-related changes of the dynamic interaction between cortical motor regions. Twenty young subjects and 20 older subjects underwent both right hand motor execution (ME) and right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) was used to compare young and older adults' effective connectivity among regions of the motor network during the tasks. The more effective connections among motor regions in older adults were found during ME; however, effective within-domain hemisphere connections were reduced, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal was significantly delayed in older adults during MI. Supplementary motor area (SMA) had a significantly higher In+Out degree within the network during ME and MI in older adults. Our results revealed a dynamic interaction within the motor network altered with aging during ME and MI, which suggested that the interaction with cortical motor neurons caused by the mental task was more difficult with aging. The age-related effects on the motor cortical network provide a new insight into our understanding of neurodegeneration in older individuals."
289,Che Chuan Wang,"Excitotoxicity induced by excessive glutamate has been implicated in many brain disorders. Xanthohumol is a natural product derived from hops (Humulus lupulus L.), which is reported to have glutamate release-inhibiting activity. However, it is unknown whether xanthohumol has protective effects against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. This study investigated the potential action of xanthohumol in a rat model of excitotoxicity induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA). Xanthohumol (10 or 50 mg/kg) administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to KA (15 mg/kg) considerably ameliorated KA-induced seizures, glutamate concentration elevation, and CA3 neuron death. The decrease of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn-2 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in hippocampal tissues following KA injection were reversed by xanthohumol. Moreover, apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) expression and caspase-3 activation in the hippocampus were inhibited by xanthohumol. These results suggest that xanthohumol up-regulates Mfn-2 and Bcl-2 to preserve mitochondrial function and suppress Apaf-1 and caspase-3 activation, thereby increasing neuron survival in rats after KA treatment. Therefore, xanthohumol has great potential for development into a therapeutic agent for improving glutamate-related nervous system diseases."
136,Yin Niu,"OBJECTIVE
To report the treatment and outcome of traumatic intracranial aneurysm (TICA) cases at the Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University in China.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
All patients diagnosed with TICA at our institution from January 1, 1977, to October 31, 2018, and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the study. Cases were reported separately for those diagnosed before 1998 and those after 1998.


RESULTS
A total of 25 patients were included in the study. Ten were diagnosed with TICA prior to 1998. Seven of these 10 patients were treated surgically with parent artery sacrificed, including aneurysmectomy, trapping, and bypass. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score for the 7 patients with surgical treatment was 3.1. Three of the 10 patients died of severe complications, including intracranial infection, delayed bleeding, and deadly injury. After 1998, 15 patients were diagnosed with TICA. Thirteen presented with head trauma and two with iatrogenic TICA following ventricle drainage or sphenoid ridge meningioma resection. Thirteen were treated with endovascular treatment, including coil alone, glue, coil-associated glue, stent alone, stent-assisted coil embolization, one with clipping, and one with conservative treatment. The 13 patients with endovascular treatment achieved a mean GOS score of 4.5. Among the 13 patients, one died from intracranial infection, one suffered recurrence, and one had intraoperative rupture.


CONCLUSION
Although the treatment of TICA has traditionally been surgical, endovascular treatment with different techniques, such as endovascular patch, provides a valuable alternative. Currently, the flow diverter is a popular embolization device and may represent another valid treatment option for TICA."
156,Antony D Abraham,"Chronic pain affects a significant percentage of the United States population, and available pain medications like opioids have drawbacks that make long-term use untenable. Cannabinoids show promise in the management of pain, but long-term treatment of pain with cannabinoids has been challenging to implement in preclinical models. We developed a voluntary, gelatin oral self-administration paradigm that allowed male and female mice to consume ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or morphine ad libitum. Mice stably consumed these gelatins over 3 weeks, with detectable serum levels. Using a real-time gelatin measurement system, we observed that mice consumed gelatin throughout the light and dark cycles, with animals consuming less THC-gelatin than the other gelatin groups. Consumption of all three gelatins reduced measures of allodynia in a chronic, neuropathic sciatic nerve injury model, but tolerance to morphine developed after 1 week while THC or CBD reduced allodynia over three weeks. Hyperalgesia gradually developed after sciatic nerve injury, and by the last day of testing, THC significantly reduced hyperalgesia, with a trend effect of CBD, and no effect of morphine. Mouse vocalizations were recorded throughout the experiment, and mice showed a large increase in ultrasonic, broadband clicks after sciatic nerve injury, which was reversed by THC, CBD, and morphine. This study demonstrates that mice voluntarily consume both cannabinoids and opioids via gelatin, and that cannabinoids provide long-term relief of chronic pain states. In addition, ultrasonic clicks may objectively represent mouse pain status and could be integrated into future pain models."
1161,Elvire Vaucher,"BACKGROUND
The cholinergic system is a potent neuromodulator system that plays a critical role in cortical plasticity, attention, and learning. Recently, it was found that boosting this system during perceptual learning robustly enhances sensory perception in rodents. In particular, pairing cholinergic activation with visual stimulation increases neuronal responses, cue detection ability, and long-term facilitation in the primary visual cortex. The mechanisms of cholinergic enhancement are closely linked to attentional processes, long-term potentiation, and modulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Some studies currently examine this effect in humans.


OBJECTIVE
The present article reviews the research from our laboratory, examining whether potentiating the central cholinergic system could help visual perception and restoration.


METHODS
Electrophysiological or pharmacological enhancement of the cholinergic system are administered during a visual training. Electrophysiological responses and perceptual learning performance are investigated before and after the training in rats and humans. This approach's ability to restore visual capacities following a visual deficit induced by a partial optic nerve crush is also investigated in rats.


RESULTS
The coupling of visual training to cholinergic stimulation improved visual discrimination and visual acuity in rats, and improved residual vision after a deficit. These changes were due to muscarinic and nicotinic transmissions and were associated with a functional improvement of evoked potentials. In humans, potentiation of cholinergic transmission with 5 mg of donepezil showed improved learning and ocular dominance plasticity, although this treatment was ineffective in augmenting the perceptual threshold and electroencephalography.


CONCLUSIONS
Potential therapeutic outcomes ought to facilitate vision restoration using commercially available cholinergic agents combined with visual stimulation in order to prevent irreversible vision loss in patients. This approach has the potential to help a large population of visually impaired individuals."
500,Loranzie S Rogers,"Many aquatic organisms use vocalizations for reproductive behavior; therefore, disruption of their soundscape could adversely affect their life history. Male oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) establish nests in shallow waters during spring and attract female fish with boatwhistle vocalizations. Males exhibit high nest fidelity, making them susceptible to anthropogenic sound in coastal waters, which could mask their vocalizations and/or reduce auditory sensitivity levels. Additionally, the effect of self-generated boatwhistles on toadfish auditory sensitivity has yet to be addressed. To investigate the effect of sound exposure on toadfish auditory sensitivity, sound pressure and particle acceleration sensitivity curves were determined using auditory evoked potentials before and after (0-, 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-day) exposure to 1- or 12-h of continuous playbacks to ship engine sound or conspecific vocalization. Exposure to boatwhistles had no effect on auditory sensitivity. However, exposure to anthropogenic sound caused significant decreases in auditory sensitivity for at least 3 days, with shifts up to 8 dB SPL and 20 dB SPL immediately following 1- and 12-h anthropogenic exposure, respectively. Understanding the effect of self-generated and anthropogenic sound exposure on auditory sensitivity provides an insight into how soundscapes affect acoustic communication."

270,Maria Martinez-Lage,"Recent work has highlighted the tumor microenvironment as a central player in cancer. In particular, interactions between tumor and immune cells may help drive the development of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Despite significant research into the molecular classification of glioblastoma, few studies have characterized in a comprehensive manner the immune infiltrate in situ and within different GBM subtypes.In this study, we use an unbiased, automated immunohistochemistry-based approach to determine the immune phenotype of the four GBM subtypes (classical, mesenchymal, neural and proneural) in a cohort of 98 patients. Tissue Micro Arrays (TMA) were stained for CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD5, CD3, CD4, CD8 (T lymphocytes), CD68 (microglia), and CD163 (bone marrow derived macrophages) antibodies. Using automated image analysis, the percentage of each immune population was calculated with respect to the total tumor cells. Mesenchymal GBMs displayed the highest percentage of microglia, macrophage, and lymphocyte infiltration. CD68+ and CD163+ cells were the most abundant cell populations in all four GBM subtypes, and a higher percentage of CD163+ cells was associated with a worse prognosis. We also compared our results to the relative composition of immune cell type infiltration (using RNA-seq data) across TCGA GBM tumors and validated our results obtained with immunohistochemistry with an external cohort and a different method. The results of this study offer a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and the infiltration of the immune components across the four commonly described GBM subgroups, setting the basis for a more detailed patient classification and new insights that may be used to better apply or design immunotherapies for GBM."
672,Jos Oudeman,"OBJECTIVE
To assess and compare the diagnostic performance of qualitative and (semi-)quantitative MRI and ultrasound for distinguishing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from segmental spinal muscular atrophy (sSMA).


METHODS
Patients with CIDP (n = 13), MMN (n = 10), or sSMA (n = 12) and healthy volunteers (n = 30) were included. MRI of the brachial plexus, using short tau inversion recovery (STIR), nerve-specific T2-weighted (magnetic resonance neurography [MRN]), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences, was evaluated. Furthermore, with ultrasound, cross-sectional areas of the nerves were evaluated. Three radiologists blinded for diagnosis qualitatively scored hypertrophy and increased signal intensity (STIR and MRN), and intraobserver and interobserver agreement was assessed. For the (semi-)quantitative modalities, group differences and receiver operator characteristics were calculated.


RESULTS
Hypertrophy and increased signal intensity were found in all groups including healthy controls. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements varied considerably (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.00-0.811 and 0.101-0.491, respectively). DTI showed significant differences (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, sSMA, and controls for fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the brachial plexus. Ultrasound showed significant differences in cross-sectional area (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA in upper arm and brachial plexus. For distinguishing immune-mediated neuropathies (CIDP and MMN) from sSMA, ultrasound yielded the highest area under the curve (0.870).


CONCLUSION
Qualitative assessment of hypertrophy and signal hyperintensity on STIR or MRN is of limited value. DTI measures may discriminate among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA. Currently, ultrasound may be the most appropriate diagnostic imaging aid in the clinical setting."
1011,Kelly Webster,"Once thought to simply reflect passive cortical idling, recent studies have demonstrated that alpha oscillations play a causal role in cognition and perception. However, whether and how cognitive or sensory processes modulate various components of the alpha rhythm is poorly understood. Sensory input and resting states were manipulated in human subjects while electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded in three conditions: eyes-open fixating on a visual stimulus, eyes-open without visual input (darkness), and eyes-closed without visual input (darkness). We show that alpha power and peak frequency increase when visual input is reduced compared to the eyes open, fixating conditions. These results suggest that increases in alpha power reflect a shift from an exteroceptive to interoceptive state and that increases in peak frequency following restricted visual input (darkness) may reflect increased sampling of the external environment in order to detect stimuli. They further demonstrate how sensory information modulates alpha and the importance of selecting an appropriate resting condition in studies of alpha.Significance Statement Alpha oscillations have long been considered to reflect a stable neural trait, but we demonstrate that alpha is a state that varies with sensory input. By manipulating both eye state and sensory input, we demonstrate that under resting state conditions, visual input drives changes in alpha power and peak frequency. These changes likely allow the visual system to dynamically switch between interoceptive and exteroceptive states to prioritize detection of weak and/or infrequent visual stimuli. This work has important implications for studies of resting state brain dynamics, which have traditionally employed a variety of resting state conditions that may or may not match task conditions in terms of sensory input."
137,Elena Pavlidis,"OBJECTIVE
To develop a standardised scheme for assessing normal and abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) features of preterm infants. To assess the interobserver agreement of this assessment scheme.


METHODS
We created a standardised EEG assessment scheme for 6 different post-menstrual age (PMA) groups using 4 EEG categories. Two experts, not involved in the development of the scheme, evaluated this on 24 infants <32 weeks gestational age (GA) using random 2 hour EEG epochs. Where disagreements were found, the features were checked and modified. Finally, the two experts independently evaluated 2 hour EEG epochs from an additional 12 infants <37 weeks GA. The percentage of agreement was calculated as the ratio of agreements to the sum of agreements plus disagreements.


RESULTS
Good agreement in all patients and EEG feature category was obtained, with a median agreement between 80% and 100% over the 4 EEG assessment categories. No difference was found in agreement rates between the normal and abnormal features (p = 0.959).


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a standard EEG assessment scheme for preterm infants that shows good interobserver agreement.


SIGNIFICANCE
This will provide information to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) staff about brain activity and maturation. We hope this will prove useful for many centres seeking to use neuromonitoring during critical care for preterm infants."
928,Nicholas J Thompson,"HYPOTHESIS
Patients with moderate-to-severe unilateral conductive hearing loss (UCHL) can make use of binaural difference cues when stimuli are presented at a high enough intensity to provide audibility in the affected ear.


BACKGROUND
Spatial hearing is essential for listening in complex environments and sound source localization. Patients with UCHL have decreased access to binaural difference cues, resulting in poorer spatial hearing abilities compared with listeners with normal hearing.


METHODS
Twelve patients with moderate-to-severe UCHL, most due to atresia (83.3%), and 12 age-matched controls with normal hearing bilaterally participated in this study. Outcome measures included: 1) spatial release from masking, and 2) sound source localization. Speech reception thresholds were measured with target speech (Pediatric AzBio sentences) presented at 0 degree and a two-talker masker that was either colocated with the target (0 degree) or spatially separated from the target (symmetrical, ±90 degrees). Spatial release from masking was quantified as the difference between speech reception thresholds in these two conditions. Localization ability in the horizontal plane was assessed in a 180 degree arc of 11 evenly-spaced loudspeakers. These two tasks were completed at 50 and 75 dB SPL.


RESULTS
Both children and adults with UCHL performed more poorly than controls when recognizing speech in a spatially separated masker or localizing sound; however, this group difference was larger at 50 than 75 dB SPL.


CONCLUSION
Patients with UCHL experience improved spatial hearing with the higher presentation level, suggesting that the auditory deprivation associated with a moderate-to-severe UCHL does not preclude exposure to-or use of-binaural difference cues."

To evaluate the relationship between obesity and urinary incontinence (UI) and to determine the effect of weight reduction on the severity of incontinence.


METHODS
This is a consensus report of the proceedings of a Research Proposal from the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society, 14 June to 16 June, 2018 (Bristol, UK): ""What are the relationships between obesity and UI, and the effects of successful bariatric surgery?""


RESULTS
Obesity is an increasing problem worldwide and is associated with many adverse effects on health and quality of life. From both translational and clinical studies, there is a strong relationship between obesity and the occurrence of UI. Both mechanical and metabolic factors seem to play an important role including systemic inflammation and oxidative stress due to the release of cytokines in visceral adipose tissue. The success rate of anti-incontinence surgery does not seem to be greatly affected by body mass index (BMI), although reliable data and long-term follow-up are currently lacking. Both weight reduction programs and bariatric surgery can result in amelioration of UI. Various studies have shown that weight loss (particularly that associated with bariatric surgery) can reduce incontinence, and the degree of weight loss is positively correlated with improvement in symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Obesity is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of both stress and urgency UI. The treatment outcome does not seem to be highly dependent on BMI. Weight reduction is positively correlated with improvement of incontinence symptoms and therefore should be advocated in the management."
553,Carlos A Loza,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim to bypass the peripheral nervous system to link the brain to external devices via successful modeling of decoding mechanisms. BCI based on electrocorticogram or ECoG represent a viable compromise between clinical practicality, spatial resolution, and signal quality when it comes to extracellular electrical potentials from local neuronal assemblies. Classic analysis of ECoG traces usually falls under the umbrella of Time-Frequency decompositions with adaptations from Fourier analysis and wavelets as its most prominent variants. However, analyzing such high-dimensional, multivariate time series demands for specialized signal processing and neurophysiological principles. We propose a generative model for single-channel ECoGs that is able to fully characterize reoccurring rhythm-specific neuromodulations as weighted activations of prototypical templates over time. The set of timings, weights and indexes comprise a temporal marked point process (TMPP) that accesses a set of bases from vector spaces of different dimensions-a dictionary. The shallow nature of the model admits the equivalence between latent variables and representations. In this way, learning the model parameters is a case of unsupervised representation learning. We exploit principles of Minimum Description Length (MDL) encoding to effectively yield a data-driven framework where prototypical neuromodulations (not restricted to a particular duration) can be estimated alongside the timings and features of the TMPP. We validate the proposed methodology on discrimination of movement-related tasks utilizing 32-electrode grids implanted in the frontal cortex of six epileptic subjects. We show that the learned representations from the high-gamma band (85-145 Hz) are not only interpretable, but also discriminant in a lower dimensional space. The results also underscore the practicality of our algorithm, i.e., 2 main hyperparameters that can be readily set via neurophysiology, and emphasize the need of principled and interpretable representation learning in order to model encoding mechanisms in the brain."
28,Christina Hofmann-Shen,"Various studies have suggested that auditory deviance detection is organized in a hierarchical manner with ascending levels of complexity. Event-related potentials (ERP) are considered to reflect different cortical processing stages. In the current electroencephalographic study, we employed an auditory sequence oddball paradigm to investigate different levels of cortical auditory processing and the contribution of neuronal habituation and prediction error mechanism to N1 and Mismatch Negativity (MMN). Our findings suggest that N1 reflects a lower cortical process primarily involved in the encoding of simple physical features and is thus mainly modulated by neuronal attenuation and not complex top-down mechanisms. By analyzing within-sequence signal differences, we divided the MMN into distinct subcomponents reflecting different hierachical levels of auditory processing. We determined a ""first-order"" MMN that reflects the processing of simple deviant features (such as frequency) and ""higher-order"" MMNs that occur at regularity violation of complex patterns or unexpected inputs that do not allow further predictions. In our source localization analysis, both the primary auditory cortex and left IFG were primarily involved in the detection of simple, physically deviant features, while the right IFG was associated with the processing of novel, unexpected auditory inputs and the ACC with regularity violation of known patterns. Summarizing, our results might contribute to a better understanding of the different complexities of neuronal habituation and prediction error mechanisms at different levels of cortical auditory processing."
955,Dorit Cohen-Carmon,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative late-onset genetic disorder caused by CAG expansions in the coding region of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in a poly-glutamine (polyQ) expanded HTT protein. Considerable efforts have been devoted for studying HD and other polyQ diseases using animal models and cell culture systems, but no treatment currently exists. Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an elegant solution for modeling human diseases. However, as embryonic or rejuvenated cells, respectively, these pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) do not recapitulate the late-onset feature of the disease. Here, we applied a robust and rapid differentiation protocol to derive electrophysiologically active striatal GABAergic neurons from human wild-type (WT) and HD ESCs and iPSCs. RNA-seq analyses revealed that HD and WT PSC-derived neurons are highly similar in their gene expression patterns. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Progerin in both WT and HD neurons exacerbated the otherwise non-significant changes in gene expression between these cells, revealing IGF1 and genes involved in neurogenesis and nervous system development as consistently altered in the HD cells. This work provides a useful tool for modeling HD in human PSCs and reveals potential molecular targets altered in HD neurons."
103,Vittoria Pagliarini,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by loss of function mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and reduced expression of the SMN protein, leading to spinal motor neuron death, muscle weakness and atrophy. Although humans harbour the highly homologous SMN2 gene, its defective splicing regulation yields a truncated and unstable SMN protein. The first therapy for SMA was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and consists of an antisense oligonucleotide (Nusinersen) rendering SMN2 functional and thus improving patients' motor activity and quality of life. Nevertheless, not all patients equally respond to this therapy and the long-term tolerability and safety of Nusinersen are still unknown. Herein, in vivo splicing assays indicated that the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 is particularly efficient in rescuing the SMN2 splicing defect in SMA fibroblasts and SMA type-I mice-derived neural stem cells. Western blot analyses showed that LBH589 also causes a significant increase in SMN protein expression in SMA cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that LBH589 treatment induces widespread H4 acetylation of the entire SMN2 locus and selectively favour the inclusion of the disease-linked exon 7 in SMN2 mature mRNA. The combined treatment of SMA cells with sub-optimal doses of LBH589 and of an antisense oligonucleotide that mimic Nusinersen (ASO_ISSN1) elicits additive effects on SMN2 splicing and SMN protein expression. These findings suggest that HDAC inhibitors can potentiate the activity of Nusinersen and support the notion that ""SMN-plus"" combinatorial therapeutic approaches might represent an enhanced opportunity in the scenario of SMA therapy."
769,Danira Bažadona,"BACKGROUND
There is a need for highly sensitive and specific tests and biomarkers that would allow preclinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which would also enable timely intervention.


NEW METHOD
We have developed a new system (ALZENTIA) that helps detect early MCI, mainly caused by AD. The system is based on a hidden goal task (HGT) in which the human subject has to find a target that is not visible; as such, the navigation is based on a previously memorized target position, in relation to the starting position (egocentric variant) and/or other navigational landmarks (allocentric variant of the task). We present our preliminary results obtained in 33 patients with MCI and 91 healthy controls (HC).


RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
Between-group differences in the average error measured in allocentric, egocentric, and combined allocentric-egocentric subtests were statistically significant in MCI compared to HC. The high negative predictive values suggested high discriminative capacity and diagnostic potential for the HGT test as a tool to detect subjects in healthy population who will progress to MCI. Considering the low sensitivity of the Mini-Mental Status Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment tests, we believe that HGT can improve early identification of MCI patients who will progress to AD.


CONCLUSION
The HGT carried out with the ALZENTIA system proved to be a reliable screening test to identify individuals with MCI from an aging cohort."
79,Chan Lin,"Stomatopod crustaceans possess tripartite compound eyes; upper and lower hemispheres are separated by an equatorial midband of several ommatidial rows. The organization of stomatopod retinas is well established, but their optic lobes have been studied less. We used histological staining, immunolabeling, and fluorescent tracer injections to compare optic lobes in two 6-row midband species, Neogonodactylus oerstedii and Pseudosquilla ciliata, to those in two 2-row midband species, Squilla empusa and Alima pacifica. Compared to the 6-row species, we found structural differences in all optic neuropils in both 2-row species. Photoreceptor axons from 2-row midband ommatidia supply two sets of lamina cartridges; however, conspicuous spaces lacking lamina cartridges are observed in locations corresponding to where the cartridges of the upper four ommatidial rows of 6-row species would exist. The tripartite arrangement and enlarged projections containing fibers associated with the two rows of midband ommatidia can be traced throughout the entire optic lobe. However, 2-row species lack some features of medullar and lobular neuropils in 6-row species. Our results support the hypothesis that 2-row midband species are derived from a 6-row ancestor, and suggest specializations in the medulla and lobula found solely in 6-row species are important for color and polarization analysis."
420,Annick Gilles,"INTRODUCTION
It was previously demonstrated that tinnitus due to profound unilateral hearing loss can be treated by the use of electrical stimulation via a cochlear implant (CI) with long-lasting positive effects. In cases where patients are not suitable for cochlear implantation due to aplasia/hypoplasia, cochlear malformations etc., an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be a solution. While auditory performance with ABI is well investigated, it is currently unknown whether stimulation through ABI also renders tinnitus reduction in patients with incapacitating tinnitus. The current case study reports on the subjective tinnitus perception during a 5-year follow-up period. In addition, a first H2O PET imaging study in an ABI patient is carried out revealing underlying neural substrates of tinnitus.


METHODS
A 56-year-old male single-sided deaf patient with incapacitating tinnitus received an ABI after insufficient auditory performances and only minor tinnitus reduction with CI. Audiological follow-up was carried out during a 5-year follow-up period comprising pure-tone audiometry, speech-in-quiet testing, speech-in-noise testing, tinnitus questionnaires (tinnitus questionnaire and numeric rating scale) and the HISQUI19 questionnaire. To investigate the neural substrates of tinnitus in this subject, H2O PET tomography scans were acquired in three different conditions: 1) ABI switched off which was considered as the resting-state measurement rendering the loudest possible tinnitus for the patient (ABI OFF); 2) ABI switched on causing a small suppression of tinnitus due to electrical stimulation (ABI ON); 3) ABI switched on and 70 dB SPL white noise presented directly to the external audio processor through a direct audio cable providing the maximum tinnitus suppression for the patient (NOISE).


RESULTS
Subjectively the patient reported a significant tinnitus reduction after implantation which remained stable over time with a decrease in tinnitus questionnaire from grade 4 to grade 2 and a 50% reduction in the numeric rating scale (from 8 to 4) during the 5-year period. Comparing the ABI OFF and ABI ON conditions, significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was observed in brain areas involved in the salience network showing already suppression of tinnitus only by electrical stimulation in the absence of auditory stimuli. The NOISE condition showed relatively decreased rCBF in the insula (as well as in the orbitofrontal cortex) as compared with the ABI OFF condition. Abnormally activated areas comprising the salience network may have been significantly suppressed by the NOISE condition both by acoustic and electrical stimulations of the auditory pathway. Moreover, the NOISE condition showed significantly decreased rCBF in the parahippocampus as compared with the ABI OFF condition. This finding supports the idea of distinct tinnitus generators depending on the amount of hearing loss.


CONCLUSION
The reduction of tinnitus in the current ABI subject may be attributable to partial peripheral reafferentation-induced deactivation of the parahippocampus-based tinnitus generator as well as the salience network. Further validation is required by the use of a follow-up study with a larger number of subjects."
956,Shivesh Ghura,"People living with HIV (PLWH) in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era may lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV. Yet, smoking rates are more than twice as high among PLWH than the general population, contributing not just to mortality but to other adverse health outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits (neuroHIV). There is growing evidence that synergy with chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation that persists despite ART may be one mechanism by which tobacco smoking contributes to neuroHIV. This review will summarize the differential effects of nicotine vs tobacco smoking on inflammation in addition to the effects of tobacco smoke components on HIV disease progression. We will also discuss biomarkers of inflammation via neuroimaging as well as biomarkers of nicotine dependence (e.g., nicotine metabolite ratio). Tobacco smoking and nicotine may impact ART drug metabolism and conversely, certain ARTs may impact nicotine metabolism. Thus, we will review these bidirectional relationships and how they may contribute to neuroHIV and other adverse outcomes. We will also discuss the effects of tobacco use on the interaction between peripheral organs (lungs, heart, kidney) and subsequent CNS function in the context of HIV. Lastly, given the dramatic rise in the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, we will discuss the implications of vaping on these processes. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of addressing tobacco use among PLWH, more research is necessary at both the preclinical and clinical level to disentangle the potentially synergistic effects of tobacco use, nicotine, HIV, cognition and immune dysregulation, as well as identify optimal approaches to reduce tobacco use. Graphical Abstract Proposed model of the relationships among HIV, ART, smoking, inflammation, and neurocognition. Solid lines represent relationships supported by evidence. Dashed lines represent relationships for which there is not enough evidence to make a conclusion. (a) HIV infection produces elevated levels of inflammation even among virally suppressed individuals. (b) HIV is associated with deficits in cognition function. (c) Smoking rates are higher among PLWH, compared to the general population. (d) The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) is associated with smoking behavior. (e) HIV and tobacco use are both associated with higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, and elevated levels of chronic stress. These factors may represent other mechanisms linking HIV and tobacco use. (f) The relationship between nicotine, tobacco smoking, and inflammation is complex, but it is well-established that smoking induces inflammation; the evidence for nicotine as anti-inflammatory is supported in some studies, but not others. (g) The relationship between tobacco use and neurocognition may differ for the effects of nicotine (acute nicotine use may have beneficial effects) vs. tobacco smoking (chronic use may impair cognition). (h) Elevated levels of inflammation may be associated with deficits in cognition. (i) PLWH may metabolize nicotine faster than those without HIV; the mechanism is not yet known and the finding needs validation in larger samples. We also hypothesize that if HIV-infection increases nicotine metabolism, then we should observe an attenuation effect once ART is initiated. (j) It is possible that the increase in NMR is due to ART effects on CYP2A6. (k) We hypothesize that faster nicotine metabolism may result in higher levels of inflammation since nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties."
391,Peter Kok,"Recent work suggests that a key function of the hippocampus is to predict the future. This is thought to depend on its ability to bind inputs over time and space and to retrieve upcoming or missing inputs based on partial cues. In line with this, previous research has revealed prediction-related signals in the hippocampus for complex visual objects, such as fractals and abstract shapes. Implicit in such accounts is that these computations in the hippocampus reflect domain-general processes that apply across different types and modalities of stimuli. An alternative is that the hippocampus plays a more domain-specific role in predictive processing, with the type of stimuli being predicted determining its involvement. To investigate this, we compared hippocampal responses to auditory cues predicting abstract shapes (Experiment 1) versus oriented gratings (Experiment 2). We measured brain activity in male and female human participants using high-resolution fMRI, in combination with inverted encoding models to reconstruct shape and orientation information. Our results revealed that expectations about shape and orientation evoked distinct representations in the hippocampus. For complex shapes, the hippocampus represented which shape was expected, potentially serving as a source of top-down predictions. In contrast, for simple gratings, the hippocampus represented only unexpected orientations, more reminiscent of a prediction error. We discuss several potential explanations for this content-based dissociation in hippocampal function, concluding that the computational role of the hippocampus in predictive processing may depend on the nature and complexity of stimuli."
167,Norio Takata,"Dynamic binding of different brain areas is critical for various cognitive functions. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a GABAergic nucleus that constrains information flow through thalamocortical loop by providing inhibitory innervation to the thalamus. In this review, I summarize anatomical and single-cell-level physiological studies of the rodent TRN. Diversity and heterogeneity of TRN neurons in terms of axonal innervation, molecular expression, and physiological characteristics are described. I also outline thalamocortical and cortico-cortical connections with emphasis on interaction with the TRN. In summary, it is proposed that functional connectivity among brain regions are modulated with gating of transthalamic information flow by the TRN."
661,Dylan Deska-Gauthier,"Neuronal diversity provides the spinal cord with the functional flexibility required to perform complex motor tasks. Spinal neurons arise during early embryonic development with the establishment of spatially and molecularly discrete progenitor domains that give rise to distinct, but highly heterogeneous, post-mitotic interneuron (IN) populations. Our previous studies have shown that Sim1-expressing V3 INs, originating from the p3 progenitor domain, are anatomically and physiologically divergent. However, the developmental logic guiding V3 subpopulation diversity remains elusive. In specific cases of other IN classes, neurogenesis timing can play a role in determining the ultimate fates and unique characteristics of distinctive subpopulations. To examine whether neurogenesis timing contributes to V3 diversity, we systematically investigated the temporal neurogenesis profiles of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord. Our work uncovered that V3 INs were organized into either early-born (E9.5-E10.5) or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves. Early-born V3 INs displayed both ascending and descending commissural projections and clustered into subgroups across dorsoventral spinal laminae. In contrast, late-born V3 INs became fate-restricted to ventral laminae, displayed mostly descending and local commissural projections, and uniform membrane properties. Furthermore, we found that the post-mitotic transcription factor, Sim1, although expressed in all V3 INs, exclusively regulated the dorsal clustering and electrophysiological diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs, which indicates that neurogenesis timing may enable new born V3 INs to interact with different post-mitotic differentiation pathways. Thus, our work demonstrates neurogenesis timing as a developmental mechanism underlying the post-mitotic differentiation of V3 INs into distinct subpopulation assemblies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTInterneuron (IN) diversity empowers the spinal cord with the computation flexibility required to perform appropriate sensorimotor control. As such, uncovering the developmental logic guiding spinal IN diversity is fundamental to understanding the development of movement. In our current work, through a focus on the cardinal spinal V3 IN population, we investigated the role of neurogenesis timing on IN diversity. We uncovered that V3 INs are organized into early-born (E9.5-E10.5) or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves, where late-born V3 INs display increasingly restricted subpopulation fates. Next, to better understand the consequences of V3 neurogenesis timing, we investigated the time-dependent functions of the Sim1 transcription factor, which is expressed in post-mitotic V3 INs. Interestingly, Sim1 exclusively regulated the diversification of early-born, but not late-born V3 INs. Thus, our current work indicates neurogenesis timing can modulate the functions of early postmitotic transcription factors, and thus, subpopulation fate specifications."
786,Maxime Parent,"Targeting mitochondrial ion homeostasis using Kaempferol, a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter channel activator, improves energy metabolism and behavior soon after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in developing rats. Due to broad TBI pathophysiology and brain mitochondrial heterogeneity, Kaempferol mediated early-stage behavioral and brain metabolic benefits may accrue from diverse sources within the brain. We hypothesized that Kaempferol influences TBI outcome by differentially impacting the neural, vascular and synaptic/axonal compartments. Following TBI at early development (P31), fMRI and DTI were applied to determine imaging outcomes at adolescence (2-months post-injury). Vehicle and Kaempferol treatments were made at 1, 24 and 48 hrs post-TBI and their effects were assessed at adolescence. A significant increase in neural connectivity was observed after Kaempferol treatment as assessed by the spatial extent and strength of the somatosensory cortical and hippocampal RSFC networks. However, no significant RSFC changes were observed in the thalamus. DTI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), representing synaptic/axonal and microstructural integrity, showed significant improvements after Kaempferol treatment, with highest changes in the frontal and parietal cortices and hippocampus. Kaempferol treatment also increased corpus callosal FA, indicating measurable improvement in the inter-hemispheric structural connectivity. TBI prognosis was significantly altered at adolescence by early Kaempferol treatment, with improved neural connectivity, neurovascular coupling and parenchymal microstructure in select brain regions. However, Kaempferol failed to improve vasomotive function across the whole brain, as measured by cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). The differential effects of Kaempferol treatment on various brain functional compartments support diverse cellular-level mitochondrial functional outcomes in vivo."
774,Yang Liu,"OBJECTIVES
To investigate the correlation between fatty infiltration in the multifidus muscle related to the involved nerve root and structural parameters associated with stenosis in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Sixty-four patients with single-segment DLSS at L4-5 were retrospectively enrolled. The fatty infiltration rate (FIR) of the multifidus muscle at L5-S1, lumbar lordosis and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the structural parameters at L4-5, such as dural sac, disc bulge, ligamentum flava and vertebral body of L5 were measured on magnetic resonance images using ImageJ software. All enrolled patients were divided into an FIR < 25 % group and an FIR ≥ 25 % group according to the FIR of the multifidus muscle at L5-S1. The propensity scores matching and adjustment of potential covariates were performed to reduce the confounding bias between the two groups.


RESULTS
Lumbar lordosis in the FIR ≥ 25 % group was significantly lower than that in the FIR＜25 % group in both cohorts. The mean differences in lumbar lordosis of 14.16 degrees between the two groups in the complete cohort and of 14.23 degrees in the matched cohort remained significant after adjustment. The disc bulge CSA/ vertebral body CSA in the FIR ≥ 25 % group was greater than that in the FIR＜25 % group in both cohorts. The mean differences in the disc bulge CSA/ vertebral body CSA between the two groups of 0.67 in the complete cohort and 0.96 in the matched cohort were statistically significant after adjustment. There was no significant difference in the dural sac CSA/ vertebral body CSA and ligamentum flava CSA/ vertebral body CSA between the two groups in either cohort regardless of adjustment. Logistic regression analysis for FIR ≥ 25 % in the multifidus muscle at L5-S1 exhibited that the disc bulge CSA/ vertebral body CSA were independent risk factors with odds ratio (OR) of 8.52, while lumbar lordosis were independent protective factors (OR = 0.72).


CONCLUSIONS
The disc bulge at the stenosis segment and lumbar lordosis reduction may be correlated with fatty infiltration in the multifidus muscles at L5-S1 in patients with L4-5 single-segment DLSS."
80,Karen Y Cheng,"Insects use vision to choose from a repertoire of flexible behaviors which they perform for survival. Decisions for behavioral plasticity are achieved through the neuromodulation of sensory processes, including motion vision. Here, we briefly review the anatomy of the insect motion vision system. Next, we review the neuromodulatory influences on motion vision. Serotonin modulates peripheral visual processing, whereas octopamine modulates all stages of visual processing tested to date. The physiological and behavioral states that elicit neuromodulation of motion vision include locomotion, changes in internal physiological state such as hunger, and changes in the external environment such as the presence of additional sensory cues. The direction of influence between these states and neuromodulators remains unknown. The influence of neuromodulators on motion vision circuitry has been revealed mostly through pharmacological application, which broadcasts widely with unnatural spatiotemporal dynamics. Thus, insight from this method is limited. Aminergic neurons likely act in local hierarchical fashion rather than globally as a group. As genetic tools advance in Drosophila, future work restricting the experimental focus to subpopulations of modulatory neurons will provide insight into the local functional modifications of visual circuits by interacting neuromodulators."
96,Xu Liu,"Polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with ischemic stroke occurrence and traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. However, few studies have examined recurrent ischemic stroke as an outcome. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine association of miRNA gene polymorphisms (namely, miR-126 rs4636297, miR-149 rs2292832, miR-124 rs531564, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-143 rs12655723, and miR-122 rs17669) with recurrence of ischemic stroke. miRNA gene polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method in 657 patients with ischemic stroke. Association of miRNA polymorphisms with prognosis outcomes was examined by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models. miR-122 rs17669 was significantly associated with recurrence risk of ischemic stroke under the recessive model. Cox regression analysis showed that the CC genotype of rs17669 was associated with an increased risk of 1.9-fold for stroke recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.879; 95% confidence interval = 1.182-2.985; P = 0.008). Further, this effect was more evident among the non-drinker and male subgroups. We found no difference in risk of recurrent ischemic stroke among the other five miRNA polymorphisms. Furthermore, we identified a significant association between the miR-149 rs2292832 polymorphism and age at onset of first-ever stroke. Altogether, miR-122 rs17669 is a significant predictor for the risk of recurrent stroke, independent of traditional risk factors."
383,I Namdar,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered to be the leading cause of disability and death among young people. Up to 30% of mTBI patients report motor impairments, such as altered coordination and impaired balance and gait. The objective of the present study was to characterize motor performance and motor learning changes, in order to achieve a more thorough understanding of the possible motor consequences of mTBI in humans. Mice were exposed to traumatic brain injury using the weight-drop model and subsequently subjected to a battery of behavioral motor tests. Immunohistochemistry was conducted in order to evaluate neuronal survival and synaptic connectivity. TBI mice showed a different walking pattern on the Erasmus ladder task, without any significant impairment in motor performance and motor learning. In the running wheels, mTBI mice showed reduced activity during the second dark phase and increased activity during the second light phase compared to the control mice. There was no difference in the sum of wheel revolutions throughout the experiment. On the Cat-Walk paradigm, the mice showed a wider frontal base of support post mTBI. The same mice spent a significantly greater percent of time standing on three paws post mTBI compared with controls. mTBI mice also showed a decrease in the number of neurons in the temporal cortex compared with the control group. In summary, mTBI mice suffered from mild motor impairments, minor changes in the circadian clock, and neuronal damage. A more in-depth examination of the mechanisms by which mTBI compensate for motor deficits is necessary."

Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AH) is a surgical option for patients with medically intractable seizures from mesial temporal lobe pathology. The transcranial route is considered the best method to achieve this goal. However, the standard approach through the neocortex is still invasive. The risks can be minimized if the mesial temporal lobe is resected while preserving the lateral temporal lobe and the Meyer's loop. This study explores the feasibility of selective AH by endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) in cadaveric specimens.


METHODS
The endoscopic anatomy of the mesial temporal lobe and the feasibility of a successful selective AH were studied in six hemispheres from three injected human cadavers. Quantitative analyses on the extent of resection and angles of exposure were performed based on CT and MRI studies of pre- and post-selective AH and measurements taken during dissections.


RESULTS
The EEA V1-V2 corridor provided a direct and logical line of access to the mesial temporal lobe, following its natural trajectory with no brain retraction and minimal exposure of the pterygopalatine fossa. The components of the mesial temporal lobe were resected just as selectively and easily as the transcranial route, but without compromising the structures of the lateral temporal lobe or the Meyer's loop.


CONCLUSIONS
The EEA V1-V2 corridor demonstrated its selective resectability and accessibility of the mesial temporal lobe in cadaveric specimens. The clinical value of this approach should be explored responsibly by a surgeon with both competent microsurgical skills and experiences in EEA."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is prevalent in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), occurring in approximately 50% of patients, and is hypothesized to be caused by disruption of neural circuits early in life. Tubers, or benign hamartomas distributed stochastically throughout the brain, are the most conspicuous of TSC neuropathology, but have not been consistently associated with ASD. Widespread neuropathology of the white matter, including deficits in myelination, neuronal migration, and axon formation, exist and may underlie ASD in TSC. We sought to identify the neural circuits associated with ASD in TSC by identifying white matter microstructural deficits in a prospectively recruited, longitudinally studied cohort of TSC infants.


METHODS
TSC infants were recruited within their first year of life and longitudinally imaged at time of recruitment, 12 months of age, and at 24 months of age. Autism was diagnosed at 24 months of age with the ADOS-2. There were 108 subjects (62 TSC-ASD, 55% male; 46 TSC+ASD, 52% male) with at least one MRI and a 24-month ADOS, for a total of 187 MRI scans analyzed (109 TSC-ASD; 78 TSC+ASD). Diffusion tensor imaging properties of multiple white matter fiber bundles were sampled using a region of interest approach. Linear mixed effects modeling was performed to test the hypothesis that infants who develop ASD exhibit poor white matter microstructural integrity over the first 2 years of life compared to those who do not develop ASD.


RESULTS
Subjects with TSC and ASD exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy in 9 of 17 white matter regions, sampled from the arcuate fasciculus, cingulum, corpus callosum, anterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the sagittal stratum, over the first 2 years of life compared to TSC subjects without ASD. Mean diffusivity trajectories did not differ between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Underconnectivity across multiple white matter fiber bundles develops over the first 2 years of life in subjects with TSC and ASD. Future studies examining brain-behavior relationships are needed to determine how variation in the brain structure is associated with ASD symptoms."
804,Melanie A Huntley,"Cortical circuit activity is shaped by the parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons that inhibit principal excitatory (EXC) neurons and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons that suppress activation of other interneurons.

The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has become increasingly employed in the treatment of suprasellar meningiomas. These tumors often cause visual symptoms due to compression of the anterior visual pathway. We aimed to examine long-term visual outcomes after EEA for optic nerve decompression and resection of suprasellar meningioma at our center, and to identify preoperative factors predictive of postoperative visual improvement.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective cohort study on 27 patients who underwent the EEA for resection of meningiomas extending into the suprasellar cistern and decompression of anterior visual pathway between January 1, 2005, and March 1, 2019.


RESULTS
We treated 8 male and 19 female patients, with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years. The mean age of our patients at initial presentation was 60.1 years. Eighteen patients (66.7%) are presented with visual acuity deficits, and 12 (44.4%) patients are presented with visual field deficits. Postoperatively, 11 patients had improved visual acuity, 6 had stable visual acuity, and 1 patient had slow and progressive decline of visual acuity; 5 patients had improved visual field, 6 had stable visual field, and 1 patient had slow and progressive decline in visual field. Patients less likely to have postoperative improvement of visual acuity were those with longer than 6-month duration of visual symptoms (P = 0.024*) as well as patients with the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) (P = 0.023*).


CONCLUSION
The EEA can achieve good visual outcomes in patients harboring suprasellar meningiomas. Symptom duration of less than 6 months and lack of a RAPD were positive predictors of postoperative visual acuity."
45,Ouyang Chen,"Inflammation is the body's protective reaction to injury and infection. Pain is a hallmark of inflammation and can be either protective or detrimental during acute or chronic phase. Macrophages play a chief role in the pathogenesis of pain and have bilateral communications with nociceptors, the specialized primary sensory neurons that sense pain. Macrophages 'talk to' nociceptors by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) that induce pain via direct activation of nociceptors. Macrophages also 'listen to' nociceptors, by which nociceptors secrete neuropeptides and chemokines which act on macrophages. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in nociceptors releases CCL2, activating macrophages and potentiating pathological pain. Emerging evidence also points to a pro-resolution role of macrophages in inflammation and pain. Macrophage GPR37 is activated by neuroprotectin D1, a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) and resolves inflammatory pain via phagocytosis and production of IL-10 that inhibits nociceptors. Macrophage-nociceptor interactions are also mediated by microRNAs and microRNA-containing exosomes in chronic pain. Notably, extracellular microRNAs (e.g. let-7b and miR-711) can directly bind and activate nociceptors. Targeting macrophage-nociceptor interactions will help to control inflammation and pain."

Neuropsychological tests are often used in aging studies to compare distinct groups regarding diagnosis and prognosis. Because sociodemographic characteristics can influence cognitive scores, measurement of invariance is useful to assess the tests' ability to estimate the underlying constructs equally across groups and thus prevent biased interpretation. This study aims to verify measurement invariance in a large and socioculturally diverse sample.


METHOD
Middle-aged and older adults (N = 13,395) from the ELSA-Brasil study were evaluated regarding health status and cognition. Mean age was 51.5 ± 8.9 years, 54% were female, 52% were white, and 10% had lower education. Measurement invariance was analyzed using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis for a two-factor model (memory and executive function). Configural, metric, and scalar invariance were tested across age, sex, race, and education groups.


RESULTS
The 2-factor model had a good fit to the entire dataset and for each group. Configural, metric, and scalar invariance confirmed that cognitive measures had the same structure and the items had similar relationships with the latent factors. Strict invariance was not achieved in most group comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
The 2-factor model was appropriate for estimating cognitive performance in participants without measurement error by age, sex, race, and education. These results suggest that differences in cognitive outcomes are likely to indicate true differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

57,Paola Pontecorvi,"BACKGROUND
Astrocytes contribute to the crosstalk that generates chronic neuro-inflammation in neurological diseases; however, compared with microglia, astrocytes respond to a more limited continuum of innate immune system stimulants. Recent studies suggest that the fibrinolysis system may regulate inflammation. The goal of this study was to test whether fibrinolysis system components activate astrocytes and if so, elucidate the responsible biochemical pathway.


METHODS
Primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia were prepared from neonatal mouse brains. The ability of purified fibrinolysis system proteins to elicit a pro-inflammatory response was determined by measuring expression of the mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). IκBα phosphorylation also was measured. Plasminogen activation in association with cells was detected by chromogenic substrate hydrolysis. The activity of specific receptors was tested using neutralizing antibodies and reagents.


RESULTS
Astrocytes expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines when treated with plasminogen but not when treated with agonists for Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4), TLR2, or TLR9. Microglia also expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to plasminogen; however, in these cells, the response was observed only when tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was added to activate plasminogen. In astrocytes, endogenously produced urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) converted plasminogen into plasmin in the absence of tPA. Plasminogen activation was dependent on the plasminogen receptor, α-enolase, and the uPA receptor, uPAR. Although uPAR is capable of directly activating cell-signaling, the receptor responsible for cytokine expression and IκBα phosphorylation response to plasmin was Protease-activated Receptor-1 (PAR-1). The pathway, by which plasminogen induced astrocyte activation, was blocked by inhibiting any one of the three receptors implicated in this pathway with reagents such as εACA, α-enolase-specific antibody, uPAR-specific antibody, the uPA amino terminal fragment, or a pharmacologic PAR-1 inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasminogen may activate astrocytes for pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the concerted action of at least three distinct fibrinolysis protease receptors. The pathway is dependent on uPA to activate plasminogen, which is expressed endogenously by astrocytes in culture but also may be provided by other cells in the astrocytic cell microenvironment in the CNS."

As an extension of a phase 2/3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) 30, 50, or 70 mg/d for 4 weeks in Japanese patients aged 6-17 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this study evaluated its long-term safety and efficacy.


METHODS
This was a multicenter, open-label study of LDX for 53 weeks. Safety was assessed by regular medical examination for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); regular recording of body weight, vital signs, and laboratory test values; and completion of dependence questionnaires. Efficacy was assessed using Japanese versions of the ADHD-Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and Conners' 3rd edition Parent Rating Scale (Conners 3); plus Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), Clinical Global Impression-Severity, and Parent Global Assessment (PGA) scales.


RESULTS
Of 132 enrolled patients, 104 completed the trial. Most frequent treatment-related TEAEs were decreased appetite (73.5%), initial insomnia (39.4%), and weight decrease (22.0%). Most TEAEs were mild (82.6% of patients). There were no serious or severe TEAEs or deaths. No treatment-related TEAEs were associated with blood pressure or pulse rate, and no patient had a QTcF interval >500 ms. Statistically significant improvement from baseline to week 53 was observed in the mean ADHD-Rating Scale-IV total score and mean Conners 3 subscale scores. Most patients showed improvement on the CGI-I (78%) and PGA (76.5%) scales.


CONCLUSIONS
No significant safety issues were observed with LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg/d administered for 1 year in Japanese children and adolescents with ADHD. LDX was associated with long-term reductions in ADHD symptoms and severity."
82,Chao Deng,"Pramipexole (PPX) is a common drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism allows PPX in the progression of Parkinson's disease remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of PPX in 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated neuroblastoma cells and explore the interaction between PPX and miR-494-3p/brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) axis. SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells challenged by MPP+ were used as cellular model of Parkinson's disease and incubated with PPX. The expression levels of miR-494-3p and BDNF were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Neurotoxicity was investigated by cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. The target association between miR-494-3p and BDNF was confirmed by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. miR-494-3p expression was increased and BDNF level was decreased in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells, which were reversed by introduction of PPX. Pramipexole attenuated cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells. Knockdown of miR-494-3p also suppressed neurotoxicity induced by MPP+ in SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells. BDNF was validated as a target of miR-494-3p and its silence abated the suppressive effect of miR-494-3p on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, addition of miR-494-3p and silence of BDNF mitigated the effect of PPX on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. PPX inhibited MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells by decreasing miR-494-3p and increasing BDNF, indicating the potential therapeutic effect of PPX on Parkinson's disease."

The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors stratifies isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas into 2 major groups depending on the presence or absence of 1p/19q codeletion. However, the grading system remains unchanged and it is now controversial whether it can be still applied to this updated molecular classification.


METHODS
In a large cohort of 911 high-grade IDH-mutant gliomas from the French national POLA network (including 428 IDH-mutant gliomas without 1p/19q codeletion and 483 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q codeleted), we investigated the prognostic value of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene homozygous deletion as well as WHO grading criteria (mitoses, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis). In addition, we searched for other retinoblastoma pathway gene alterations (CDK4 amplification and RB1 homozygous deletion) in a subset of patients. CDKN2A homozygous deletion was also searched in an independent series of 40 grade II IDH-mutant gliomas.


RESULTS
CDKN2A homozygous deletion was associated with dismal outcome among IDH-mutant gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion (P < 0.0001 for progression-free survival and P = 0.004 for overall survival) as well as among anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, IDH-mutant + 1p/19q codeleted (P = 0.002 for progression-free survival and P < 0.0001 for overall survival) in univariate and multivariate analysis including age, extent of surgery, adjuvant treatment, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis. In both groups, the presence of microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis remained of prognostic value only in cases lacking CDKN2A homozygous deletion. CDKN2A homozygous deletion was not recorded in grade II gliomas.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study pointed out the utmost relevance of CDKN2A homozygous deletion as an adverse prognostic factor in the 2 broad categories of IDH-mutant gliomas stratified on 1p/19q codeletion and suggests that the grading of these tumors should be refined."

While consistently recommended, the significance of early ambulation after surgery has not been definitively studied.


OBJECTIVE
To identify the relationship between ambulation on the day of surgery (postoperative day (POD)#0) and 90-d adverse events after lumbar surgery.


METHODS
The Michigan Spine Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MSSIC) is a prospective multicenter registry of spine surgery patients. As part of routine postoperative care, patients either ambulated on POD#0 or did not. The 90-d adverse events of length of stay (LOS), urinary retention (UR), urinary tract infection (UTI), ileus, readmission, surgical site infection (SSI), pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT), and disposition to a rehab facility were measured.


RESULTS
A total of 23 295 lumbar surgery patients were analyzed. POD#0 ambulation was associated with decreased LOS (relative LOS 0.83, P < .001), rehab discharge (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, P < .001), 30-d (OR 0.85, P = .044) and 90-d (OR 0.86, P = .014) readmission, UR (OR 0.73, P = 10), UTI (OR 73, P = .001), and ileus (OR 0.52, P < .001) for all patients. Significant improvements in LOS, rehab discharge, readmission, UR, UTI, and ileus were observed in subset analysis of single-level decompressions (4698 pts), multilevel decompressions (4079 pts), single-level fusions (4846 pts), and multilevel fusions (4413 pts). No change in rate of SSI or DVT/PE was observed for patients who ambulated POD#0.


CONCLUSION
POD#0 ambulation is associated with a significantly decreased risk for several key adverse events after lumbar spine surgery. Decreasing the incidence of these outcomes would be associated with significant cost savings. As ambulation POD#0 is a modifiable factor in any patient's postoperative care following most spine surgery, it should be encouraged and incorporated into spine-related, enhanced-recovery-after-surgery programs."
502,Senem Zeytinoğlu-Saydam,"PURPOSE
This study investigated the risk for children with non-syndromic craniosynostosis to develop behavioral problems during school age determined by the type of craniosynostisis, age at first surgery, and number of surgeries.


METHOD
Final sample consisted of 43 children aged between 6 years and 8 months and 17 years and 1 month (M = 10 years and 5 months). Behavioral problems were assessed with Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL).


RESULTS
Our sample had higher scores on the CBCL than the general population; specific elevations were observed including somatic complaints, aggressive behavior, social problems, attention problems, and thought problems and rule-breaking behavior. Behavioral functioning varied by number of surgical procedures, type of craniosynostosis, and age at first surgery.


CONCLUSION
For school-aged NSC children's behavioral functioning, diagnosis specific patterns especially impacted by the first age of the surgery and number of surgeries."

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), resulting from an immune-associated destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells, has been reported in a few earlier studies to be inversely associated with schizophrenia, but not with schizophrenia-like psychoses. The aim of this study was to verify this finding by carrying out a Swedish register study.


METHODS
Data from the Total Population- and Medical Birth-Registers were used to create a cohort of all individuals born in Sweden 1987-2004. The cohort individuals were linked with the Inpatient- and Outpatient-Registers and followed from birth to 2017 to identify onset of T1DM, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the association between T1DM and risk of developing schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during a follow-up from age 13.


RESULTS
The study population included 1 745 977 individuals and the length of follow-up was maximally 18.0 (median 9.7) years. During the follow-up, 1 280 individuals developed schizophrenia and 649 individuals schizoaffective disorder. The risk of developing schizophrenia was significantly lower among individuals with, than among individuals without, a diagnosis of T1DM, whereas the risk of developing schizoaffective disorder did not differ among individuals with or without a T1DM diagnosis [adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval); schizophrenia: 0.29 (0.09-0.91), p=0.0338, schizoaffective disorder: 1.50 (0.71-3.16), p=0.2909].


CONCLUSIONS
This study, in line with previous studies, shows that a diagnosis of T1DM is associated with a decreased risk of schizophrenia. This finding of an inverse association between T1DM and schizophrenia may bring an interesting piece, related to autoimmunity, into the schizophrenia-aetiology puzzle."

934,Morgane Prime,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
People with Parkinson disease (PD) present phenotypes that are characterized as tremor-dominant (TD) or postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes. Differentiation of subtypes allows clinicians to predict disease course and adjust treatment. We examined whether brief mobility and balance measures can discriminate PIGD from TD phenotypes.


METHODS
We performed a cross-sectional study with individuals with PD (n = 104). Blinded raters assessed participants with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) or Movement Disorders Society revision (MDS-UPDRS), and balance assessments: 360° turn test, one-leg stance, a reactive postural control test, and tandem walk. Participants were classified as PIGD or TD based on the UPDRS or MDS-UPDRS assessment results. Differences in balance variables between subtypes were assessed with univariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to investigate the ability of balance variables to differentiate PD subtypes.


RESULTS
No differences between subtypes were observed for tandem walk or reactive postural control. Participants with PIGD performed worse on number of steps and time to complete the 360° turn test and on one-leg stance time. ROC curves showed only the 360° turn test discriminated PIGD from TD with high specificity (0.84). Post hoc analyses revealed that the 360° turn test is the most discriminatory for classifying PD subtypes in early stages of the disease. ROC analyses based on combined models including both the 360° test and tandem walk test performance increased the specificity to 0.97.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The 360° turn test requires minimal time to administer and may be useful in mild-moderate PD for distinguishing PIGD from TD subtypes.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A295)."

1056,Manhua Liu,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity coefficient of 87.0% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.5% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2% and an AUC of 77.5% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several other competing methods."

The nature of the relationship between spinal cord syrinx and tethered cord is not well known. It is unclear if surgical cord untethering results in resolution or improvement of an associated syrinx. The objective of this study was to report the response of spinal cord syrinx to surgical cord untethering.


METHODS
The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients with a syrinx and tethered cord who presented to a single institution over an 11-year interval. Patients with open neural tube defects were excluded. Thirty-one patients were identified, 25 of whom had both clinical and imaging follow-up after surgery. Patients were grouped according to etiology of the tethered cord. Clinical outcomes and syrinx characteristics were recorded.


RESULTS
Of the 25 patients with tethered cord, 68% (n = 17) were male. The average age at presentation was 2.5 years (0-10.1 years) and age at surgery was 3.7 years (range 1 day to 17 years). Etiologies of tethered cord were lipomyelomeningocele (n = 8), thickened/fatty filum (n = 7), intradural lipoma (n = 5), myelocystocele (n = 2), meningocele (n = 2), and diastematomyelia (n = 1). Twenty-three of the patients underwent primary untethering, whereas 2 patients had received untethering previously at another institution. The average syrinx length and width prior to surgery were 4.81 vertebral levels (SD 4.35) and 5.19 mm (SD 2.55 mm), respectively. Conus level ranged from L1 to S3. Patients were followed for an average of 8.4 years (1.35-15.85 years). Overall there was no significant change in syrinx length or width postoperatively; the average syrinx length increased by 0.86 vertebral levels (SD 4.36) and width decreased by 0.72 mm (SD 2.94 mm). Seven of 25 patients had improvement in at least one presenting symptom, including scoliosis, weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and pain. Eight patients had stable presenting symptoms. Six patients were asymptomatic and 5 patients had new or worsening symptoms, which included scoliosis, pain, or sensory changes.


CONCLUSIONS
Although some syrinxes improved after surgery for tethered cord, radiological improvement was not consistent and did not appear to be associated with change in clinical symptoms. The decision to surgically untether a cord should be focused on the clinical symptoms and not the presence of a syrinx alone. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding."

Selection procedure was a convenience sample of pregnant patients who presented for office visits or vaginal or cesarean delivery between March 15 and July 31, 2018, at a single-center obstetric tertiary care university hospital. Both techniques were evaluated by 2 physicians independently assessing each method. Before data collection, we hypothesized that the SAIL technique would be more accurate than the ICL technique in determining the L4-L5 interspace, and that the SAIL technique would produce more estimations below the third lumbar vertebra than the ICL technique. Therefore, the primary outcome was accuracy in identifying the L4-L5 lumbar interspace with SAIL vs ICL. The secondary outcome was difference in clinical assessments above the third lumbar vertebra. Both outcomes were measured via ultrasonography.


RESULTS
Patients were 31 ± 5 years of age (mean ± SD) and had body mass index of 31.8 ± 5.7 kg/m2 and gestational age of 38.8 ± 1.1 weeks. A total of 110 patients were analyzed. SAIL correctly identified the L4-L5 interspace 49% of the time vs 8% using ICL (p < 0.0001). Estimations above L3 were 1% for SAIL vs 31% for ICL (p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study shows improved accuracy in identifying intervertebral space using the SAIL technique; this may prevent direct mechanical trauma to the conus medullaris when lumbar punctures are performed in pregnancy.

764,Madelyne A Bisby,"Adolescence is characterised by substantial changes in emotion regulation and in particular, impaired extinction consolidation and retention. In this study, we replicated the well-established finding that increasing the activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) via the agonist WIN55212-2 improves fear extinction in adult rodents before examining whether this adjunct would also rescue the extinction retention deficit seen in adolescent rodents. Contrary to the effects in adults, we found that WIN55212-2 impaired within-session acquisition of extinction in adolescent rats with no effect on extinction retention. The same effects of WIN55212-2 were observed for juvenile rats, and did not vary as a function of drug dose. Increased fear expression observed during extinction training was not a result of altered locomotor or anxiety-like behaviour in adolescent rats, as assessed by the open field test. Lastly, we observed a linear decrease in CB1R protein expression across age (i.e., from juveniles, to adolescents, and adults) in both the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, two regions implicated in fear expression and extinction, suggesting that there is continued refinement of the endocannabinoid system across development in two regions involved in extinction. Our findings suggest that the expression and extinction of fear in developing rats is differentially affected by CB1R agonism due to an immature endocannabinoid system."
105,Gali Umschweif,"Extensive preclinical research has been conducted in recent years to reveal the cell types, neuronal circuits, molecular and morphological changes implicated in the function of the dentate gyrus in depression. This was profoundly facilitated by the emergence of methods such as gene targeting, neuronal cell activity manipulation, including optogenetics and chemogenetics, as well as the development of novel RNA sequencing technology and powerful MRI imagers that was used in clinical studies. These advancements provided researchers with the precise skills needed to evaluate the changes in the dentate gyrus structure and cell function in rodent models as well as in brains of depressed and medicated patients. Here we review these latest findings and discuss the existing gaps in our knowledge of the role of the dentate gyrus in depression and in mediating the response to antidepressant therapies."
426,Sarra Djemil,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known to play a role in cognitive functions of the hippocampus, such as memory consolidation. Given that they conduct Ca2+ and are capable of regulating the release of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the hippocampus, thereby shifting the excitatory-inhibitory ratio, we hypothesized that the activation of nAChRs will result in the potentiation of hippocampal networks and alter synchronization. We used nicotine as a tool to investigate the impact of activation of nAChRs on neuronal network dynamics in primary embryonic rat hippocampal cultures prepared from timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. We perturbed cultured hippocampal networks with increasing concentrations of bath-applied nicotine and performed network extracellular recordings of action potentials using a microelectrode array (MEA). We found that nicotine modulated network dynamics in a concentration-dependent manner; it enhanced firing of action potentials as well as facilitated bursting activity. In addition, we used pharmacological agents to determine the contributions of discrete nAChR subtypes to the observed network dynamics. We found that β4-containing nAChRs are necessary for the observed increases in spiking, bursting and synchrony, while the activation of α7 nAChRs augments nicotine-mediated network potentiation but is not necessary for its manifestation. We also observed that antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) partially blocked the effects of nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine exposure promoted autophosphorylation of Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and serine 831 phosphorylation of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1. These results suggest that nicotinic receptors induce potentiation and synchronization of hippocampal networks and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Findings from this work highlight the impact of cholinergic signaling in generating network-wide potentiation in the form of enhanced spiking and bursting dynamics that coincide with molecular correlates of memory such as increased phosphorylation of CaMKII and GluA1."
72,Joseph Haynes,"We present a patient who was diagnosed 20 yr prior to current presentation with a spinal arteriovenous malformation. This patient had a 10-yr history of worsening back pain (and underwent lumbar fusion), urinary dysfunction leading to 3-yr dependence on intermittent catheterization, lower extremity paresthesias and pain, and progressive weakness with multiple falls, leading to walker then wheelchair dependence for mobility. Magnetic resonance studies showed extensive thoracic cord expansion and edema with enlarged spinal cord surface veins and flow voids extending from spinal levels T6 to the conus medullaris. Partial embolization at an outside institution elicited transient symptom improvement. Repeated spinal angiogram demonstrated persistent T10 pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) supplied by the posterior spinal artery arising from the right T11 segmental artery as well as by the anterior spinal artery from the left T10 segmental artery. Because additional embolization carried significant risk, we planned open surgery with fistula resection. Informed consent for the surgery and video recording was obtained. The patient was placed in the prone position, and a radial artery access was obtained for intraoperative angiogram. Following a posterior T9-T11 laminectomy and dural opening, a pial dissection was performed to expose the AVF. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography was used to assist in identifying the feeders and major drainage of the AVF. Post-AVF resection, a formal intraoperative radial access spinal angiogram demonstrated complete resection of the lesion with no residual shunt or early venous drainage. The patient improved significantly and, on last follow-up, is ambulating without any assistive devices."
613,Kaimin Wu,"Objective: To investigate prospective associations between triglyceride (TG) level and prognosis of first-attacked patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Methods: This retrospective study included 196 patients newly diagnosed with NMOSD from June 2014 to December 2018. Data of clinical parameters, including age of onset, sex, BMI, blood lipid levels, anti-aquaporin-4 status, serum glucose level, therapy regimens, comorbidities, initial Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), relapses, and outcomes were collected. We used logistic regression models to examine the associations among relevant clinical factors and outcomes, and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 23.0 software. Results: Compared with the high TG group, residual EDSS was relatively lower in the normal TG group (median 1.0 vs. 2.0, P = 0.002). In the univariate analysis, TG level was positively correlated with outcomes (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18-2.60, P = 0.005) and relapses (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.07-2.31, P = 0.02). Our stratified analysis suggested that patients with normal BMI (OR 4.90, 95% CI 2.10-11.44, P = 0.001) were closely correlated with poor recovery owing to increased TG level. In the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association still existed between TG level and outcomes (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.02-11.64; P = 0.040) after adjusting for various variables. Conclusions: In first-attacked NMOSD patients, TG level was positively associated with poor recovery. Early monitoring and treatment of elevated TG level in NMOSD patients are important."
853,Mark E Whitlock,"Objective: We investigated the accuracy of the often-stated assumption that placebo nonadditivity and an increasing placebo response are major problems in clinical trials and the cause of a trend for smaller treatment effects observed in clinical trials for major depressive disorder (MDD) in recent years. Method of research: We reviewed data from 122 MDD trials conducted between the years 1983 and 2010 (analyzed originally by Undurraga and Baldessarini in 2012) to determine whether the data support the assumption of placebo additivity. Statistical techniques, such as conventional least squares regression, orthogonal least squares regression and locally weighted loess smoothing, were applied to the data set. Results: Re-analysis of the data set showed the active and placebo responses to be highly correlated, to the degree that would be expected assuming placebo additivity, when random variability in both active and placebo response is considered. Despite the placebo responses in MDD trials increasing up to approximately the year 1998, we found no evidence that it has continued to increase since this date, or that it has been the cause of smaller reported treatment effects in recent years. Conclusion: Attempts to reduce the placebo response are unlikely to increase the treatment effect since they are likely to reduce drug nonspecific effects in the treatment arm by a similar amount. Thus, it should come as no surprise that trial designs set up with the sole purpose of reducing placebo response fail to discernibly benefit our ability to identify new effective treatments."
612,Chao-Sheng Chang,"Mirror therapy (MT) facilitates motor learning and induces cortical reorganization and motor recovery from stroke. We applied the new digital mirror therapy (DMT) system to compare the cortical activation under the three visual feedback conditions: (1) no mirror visual feedback (NoMVF), (2) bilateral synchronized task-based mirror visual feedback training (BMVF), and (3) reciprocal task-based mirror visual feedback training (RMVF). During DMT, EEG recordings, including time-dependent event-related desynchronization (ERD) signal amplitude in both mu and beta bands, were obtained from the standard C3 (ispilesional hemisphere, IH), C4 (contralesional hemisphere, CH), and Cz scalp sites (supplementary motor area, SMA). The entire ERD curve was separated into three time-phases: P0 (-2 to 0 s), P1 (0 to 2 s), and P2 (2 to 4 s). Four-way and subsequent repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to examine the effects of group (stroke vs. control group), test condition (NoMVF, BMVF, and RMVF), time-phase (P0, P1, and P2), and brain area (IH, CH, SMA) on the ERD areas (%) in mu and beta bands. For the mu band, generally, ERD areas (%) were larger in the control than in the stroke group. The ERD areas (%) were largest under the RMVF condition, followed by BMVF and NoMVF conditions. Similar results were found in the beta bands. The main effects of group, time-phase, and test condition on the ERD areas (%) were significant for the three brain areas, except the main effect of group in the SMA (Cz) and CH (C4) brain area. The ERD areas (%) were larger in the control than in the stroke group. The ERD area (%) was significantly larger during P1 than during P0 and P2 (ps < 0.02), and during P2 than during P0 (ps < 0.01). The ERD area (%) under the RMVF condition was significantly larger than that under the BMVF condition and NoMVF condition (ps < 0.05). The present study suggests that cortical activation particularly in the SMA (Cz) of the brain increases in the RMVF condition in both healthy subjects and stroke patients. This result supports the hypothesis that stroke patients may benefit from RMVF training."
187,Emma Murray,"Puberty is a critical period of neural development, and exposure to stress and inflammation during this period is thought to increase vulnerability to mental illness. The gut microbiome influences brain functioning and behavior and impacts mental health. Yet, the role of the gut microbiome during puberty, a period during which mental health conditions tend to onset, remains largely uninvestigated. We first examined age and sex differences in gut microbial changes among CD-1 mice exposed to an immune challenge (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) at 6 weeks of age (during the pubertal stress-sensitive period) or at 10 weeks of age (in adulthood) (Experiment 1). Compared to their adult counterparts, pubertal males and females showed more significant changes in gut microbial composition following LPS treatment, including the depletion of numerous bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus. Given the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus strains on stress and behaviour, we next investigated whether replenishment of the gut with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) throughout pubertal development would modulate LPS-induced sickness and enduring effects on memory dysfunction, anxiety-like behaviour and stress reactivity in adulthood (Experiment 2). LPS treatment at 6 weeks of age created enduring changes in anxiety-like behaviors among males only. Similarly, only males showed the protective effects of L. reuteri supplementation during puberty in preventing longstanding LPS-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior and stress-induced brain activation. These findings demonstrate that colonizing the gut with L. reuteri during puberty modulates sickness responses and enduring behavioural and neurochemical outcomes in a sex-specific manner. Therefore, colonizing the gut with beneficial microbes may protect against the development of mental illnesses in adulthood."
1150,Christian Meisel,"Epilepsy treatment is challenging due to a lack of essential diagnostic tools, including methods for reliable seizure detection in the ambulatory setting, to assess seizure risk over time and to monitor treatment efficacy. This lack of objective diagnostics constitutes a significant barrier to better treatments, raises methodological concerns about the antiseizure medication evaluation process and, to patients, is a main issue contributing to the disease burden. Recent years have seen rapid progress towards better diagnostics that meet these needs of epilepsy patients and clinicians. Availability of comprehensive data and the rise of more powerful computational analysis methods have driven progress in this area. Here, we provide an overview on data- and theory-driven approaches aimed at identifying methods to reliably detect and forecast seizures as well as to monitor brain excitability and treatment efficacy in epilepsy. We provide a particular account on neural criticality, the hypothesis that cortical networks may be poised in a critical state at the boundary between different types of dynamics, and discuss its role in informing diagnostics to track cortex excitability and seizure risk in recent experiments. With the further expansion of digitalization in medicine, tele-medicine and long-term, ambulatory monitoring, these computationally based methods may gain more relevance in epilepsy  in the future."
573,Kazuya Honjoh,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of normal sensation and often leads to debilitating neuropathic pain (NeP). Chronic NeP develops at or below the SCI lesion in as many as 80% of patients with SCI and may be induced by modulators of neuronal excitability released from activated microglia and macrophages. In the inflammatory response after SCI, different microglia/macrophage populations that are classically activated (M1 phenotype) or alternatively activated (M2 phenotype) have become of great interest. Chemokines have also recently attracted attention in neuron-microglia communication. CCL21 is a chemokine that activates microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) and is expressed only in neurons with an insult or mechanical injury. In this study using an SCI model in mutant (plt) mice with deficient CCL21 expression, we assessed post-SCI NeP and expression of microglia/macrophages and inflammatory cytokines at the injured site and lumbar enlargement. SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation were relieved in plt mice compared with those in wild-type (C57BL/6) mice, although there was no difference in motor function. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis showed that the phenotype of microglia/macrophages was M1 type-dominant in both types of mice at the lesion site and lumbar enlargement. A decrease of M1-type microglia/macrophages was seen in plt mice compared with wild-type, while the number of M2-type microglia/macrophages did not differ between these mice. In immunoblot analysis, expression of M1-induced cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ)] was decreased in plt mice, while that of M2-induced cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4, IL-10) did not differ in the two types of mice. The results of this study indicate that suppression of expression of inflammatory cytokines by decreasing the number of M1-type microglia/macrophages at the injured site and lumbar enlargement is associated with provision of an environment for reduction of NeP. These findings may be useful for the design of new therapies to alleviate NeP after SCI."
448,Nyssa Z Bulkes,"We investigated the role that semantic constraint and participant control over stimulus presentation have on early stages of visual word recognition. Namely, we tested how the presence of a highly constraining sentential context influences the expectations that readers have during incremental sentence processing. Further, we tested whether allowing participants to self-pace the experiment affected early sensory perceptions of written stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in three experiments. Participants read sentences containing a target word from one of four conditions: 1) the target, spelled as expected; 2) the target with two internal characters transposed; 3) a nonword one vowel different from a target; or 4) an illegal consonant string. In Experiment 1, sentences were minimally constraining up to the target word (average cloze at target word: 0.01); in Experiments 2 and 3, sentences were highly constraining (average cloze at target word: 0.93). In both Experiments 1 and 2, sentences were presented using rapid-serial-visual presentation (RSVP). In Experiment 3, participants saw the same sentences used in Experiment 2 but were allowed to self-pace the presentation of each word in every trial. In Experiments 1 and 2, results showed early neural sensitivity to nonsensical consonant strings only, and only when they appeared within high constraint. In Experiment 3, results showed graded N170 effects to all target words containing unexpected visual information. P600 modulations were observed in all three experiments, indexing the difficulty of processing unexpected orthography, particularly in downstream, integrative processing. Results support a nuanced view of early visual processing, namely one arguing that visual processing is more fine-grained the more control participants have over how they read."

498,Feng-Xiang Wang,"BACKGROUND
Brain tumors cause significant morbidity and mortality due to rapid progression and high recurrence risks. Reliable biomarkers to improve diagnosis thereof are desirable.


OBJECTIVE
This work aimed to identify panels of biomarkers for diagnostic purposes using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based metabolomics.


METHODS
A cohort of 163 histologically-proven patients with brain disorders was involved. Comprehensive CSF-based metabolomics was achieved by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight spectrometric (LC-Q/TOF-MS) and multivariate statistical analyses. The diagnostic performance of the metabolic markers was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.


RESULTS
A total of 508 ion features were detected by the LC-Q/TOF-MS analysis, of which 27 metabolites were selected as diagnostic markers to discriminate different brain tumor types. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.91 for lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases (MBT) vs. lung adenocarcinoma patients without brain metastases (NMBT), 0.83 for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) vs. secondary central nervous system involvement of systemic lymphoma (SCNSL), 0.77 for PCNSL vs. MBT, 0.87 for SCNSL vs. MBT, 0.86 for MBT vs. nontumorous brain diseases (NT), and 0.80 for PCNSL vs. NT. Perturbed metabolic pathways between the comparisons related mainly to amino acids and citrate metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
CSF-based metabolomics to a large extent reliably identifies significant metabolic differences between different brain tumors and shows great potential for diagnosis of brain tumors."
1154,M Burhan Janjua,"Colloid cyst are cystic lesions in the third ventricle and could render patients asymptomatic. However, there is an inherent risk of symptomatic progression, acute decompensation, and sudden death. Therefore, there is no clear consensus as how to observe or when to treat a newly diagnosed patient with a colloid cyst. The authors' objective is to identify the risk factors and then develop a risk stratification score to guide neurosurgeons during acute or chronic presentation. Radiological imaging characteristics have been outlined for the risk stratification as well preoperative evaluation. A baseline neuropsychological evaluation is helpful to obtain during an incidental presentation because history and neurological examination could be inconclusive in these cases. Radiological imaging with an MRI brain scan plays a vital role for the initial screening (determination of the cyst size, exact location, and the imaging characteristics) as well as for the preoperative planning. Stereotactic guidance is a high yield, followed by neuroendoscopic resection of the colloid cyst has been an established approach to resect these lesions. Modified colloid cyst risk scoring (mCCRS) system is robust and detailed for the optimal risk stratification of colloid cyst presentation. Stereotactic guided neuroendoscopic resection of the colloid cyst is a safe and efficacious approach to manage these lesions. The intended use, crucial steps involved, and the limitations of the technique have been discussed especially with a focus on the recurrence. Moreover, a comprehensive treatment algorithm has been presented."
20,Brecht Polspoel,"Only a small amount of studies have looked at the structural neural correlates of children's arithmetic. Furthermore, these studies mainly implemented voxel-based morphometry, which only takes the volume of regions into account, without looking at other structural properties. The current study aimed to contribute knowledge on which brain regions are important for children's arithmetic on a structural level, by not only implementing voxel-based morphometry, but also cortical complexity analyses, based on the fractal dimension index. This complexity measure describes a characteristic of surface shape. Data of 43 typically developing 9-10 year-olds were analyzed. All children were asked to take part in two test sessions: behavioral data collection and MRI data acquisition. For data analysis, mean values for volume and cortical complexity were estimated within regions of interest (ROIs) and extracted for further analysis. The selected ROIs were based on regions found to be related to children's mathematical abilities in previous research. Results point towards associations between arithmetic fluency and the volume of the right fusiform gyrus, as well as the cortical complexity of the left postcentral gyrus, right insular sulcus, and left lateral orbital sulcus. Remarkably, no significant associations were observed between the children's arithmetic fluency and the volume or cortical complexity of typically arithmetic-associated parietal regions, such as the superior parietal lobe, intraparietal sulcus, or angular gyrus. Accordingly, the current study highlights the importance of structural characteristics of brain regions other than these typically arithmetic-associated parietal regions for children's arithmetic fluency."
990,Sonia Tejada Solís,"INTRODUCTION
New intraoperative imaging techniques, which aim to improve tumour resection, have been implemented in recent years in brain tumour surgery, although they lead to an increase in resources. In order to carry out an update on this topic, this manuscript has been drafted by a group from the Sociedad Española de Neurocirugía (Spanish Society of Neurosurgery).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Experts in the use of each one of the most-used intraoperative techniques in brain tumour surgery were presented with a description of the technique and a brief review of the literature. Indications for use, their advantages and disadvantages based on clinical experience and on what is published in the literature will be described.


RESULTS
The most robust intraoperative imaging technique appears to be low- and high-field magnetic resonance imaging, but this is the technique which results in the greatest expenditure. Intraoperative ultrasound navigation is portable and less expensive, but it provides poorer differentiation of high-grade tumours and is observer-dependent. The most-used fluorescence techniques are 5-aminolevulinic acid for high-grade gliomas and fluorescein, useful in lesions which rupture the blood-brain barrier. Last of all, intraoperative CT is more versatile in the neurosurgery operating theatre, but it has fewer indications in neuro-oncology surgery.


CONCLUSIONS
Intraoperative imaging techniques are used with increasingly greater frequency in brain tumour surgery, and the neurosurgeon should assess their possible use depending on their resources and the needs of each patient."
100,Zhara Hakimi,"Inflammation can cause memory impairment. In the present study, the effect of carvacrol on brain tissue inflammation and oxidative stress as well as learning and memory in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged rats was evaluated. The animals were grouped and treated: (1) control which received vehicle instead of LPS and carvacrol, (2) LPS (1 mg/kg; i.p. 120 min before behavioral tests), and (3-5) in these groups, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of carvacrol (i.p.) was administered 30 min prior to LPS. In a Morris water maze test, compared to LPS group, administration of all three doses of carvacrol shortened the elapsed time and the traveled distance to find the platform, while it prolonged the traveled time in the target area. In a passive avoidance test, administration of all 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg carvacrol significantly increased the latency at the 3 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the shock compared to the LPS group. Interleukin (IL)-6, malondialdehyde (MDA), and NO (nitric oxide) metabolites were increased in the brain by LPS injection, while thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were decreased. Pretreatment with carvacrol reduced IL-6, NO metabolites, and MDA, while it improved thiol content, CAT, and SOD. The results indicated that carvacrol protected from learning and memory impairment and the brain tissue inflammation and oxidative stress in LPS-challenged rats."
691,Stanimir Sirakov,"We present a case of successful embolization of a recurrent wide neck bifurcation aneurysm with a Barrel vascular reconstruction device (VRD). The unique properties of this novel device allowed optimal aneurysm neck coverage during third consecutive re-treatment, ultimately resulting in complete aneurysm obliteration. The parent vessel anatomy and the neck morphology of the aneurysm, in combination with a presence of a large pre-existing coil mass, were ideal for Barrel stent placement. The expanded portion of the device conformed perfectly to the recanalized aneurysm neck, providing optimal support for additional coil embolization. This case illustrates the advantages of Barrel VRD for definitive embolization of large, recurrent, and previously coiled wide-neck bifurcation aneurysm as a reasonable alternative to other traditional treatment modalities, such as flow diversion or Y and X stenting."
548,Cheng-Kun Deng,"Cognitive dysfunction is a very severe consequence of diabetes, but the underlying causes are still unclear. Recently, the cerebellum was reported to play an important role in learning and memory. Since long-term depression (LTD) is a primary cellular mechanism for cerebellar motor learning, we aimed to explore the role of cerebellar LTD pathways in diabetic rats and the therapeutic effect of gastrodin. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin into adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Motor learning ability was assessed by a beam walk test. Pathological changes of the cerebellum were assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by anti-caspase-3 immunostaining. Protein expression levels of LTD pathway-related factors, including GluR2, protein kinase C (PKC), NR2A, and nNOS, in the cerebellar cortex were evaluated by western blotting and double immunofluorescence. The NO concentration was measured. The cellular degeneration and the apoptosis of Purkinje cells were evident in the cerebellum of diabetic rats. Protein expression levels of GluR2 (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.81 ± 0.07), PKC (NC9W: 1.66 ± 0.10; DM9W + S: 0.58 ± 0.19), NR2A (NC9W: 1.40 ± 0.05; DM9W + S: 0.63 ± 0.06), nNOS (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.68 ± 0.04), and NO (NC9W: 135.61 ± 31.91; DM9W + S: 64.06 ± 24.01) in the cerebellum were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Following gastrodin intervention, the outcome of motor learning ability was significantly improved (NC9W: 6.70 ± 3.31; DM9W + S: 20.47 ± 9.43; DM9W + G: 16.04 ± 7.10). In addition, degeneration and apoptosis were ameliorated, and this was coupled with the elevation of the protein expression of the abovementioned biomarkers. Arising from the above, we concluded that gastrodin may contribute to the improvement of motor learning by protecting the LTD pathways in Purkinje cells."
767,Marion Zanese,"BACKGROUND
Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a fundamental molecular process involved in the regulation of signaling activities in living organisms. Understanding this complex network of phosphorylation, especially phosphoproteins, is a necessary step for grasping the basis of cellular pathophysiology. Studying brain intracellular signaling is a particularly complex task due to the heterogeneous complex nature of the brain tissue, which consists of many embedded structures.


NEW METHOD
Overcoming this degree of complexity requires a technology with a high throughput and economical in the amount of biological material used, so that a large number of signaling pathways may be analyzed in a large number of samples. We have turned to Alpha (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) technology.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD
Western blot is certainly the most commonly used method to measure the phosphorylation state of proteins. Even though Western blot is an accurate and reliable method for analyzing modifications of proteins, it is a time-consuming and large amounts of samples are required. Those two parameters are critical when the goal of the research is to comprehend multi-signaling proteic events so as to analyze several targets from small brain areas.


RESULT
Here we demonstrate that Alpha technology is particularly suitable for studying brain signaling pathways by allowing rapid, sensitive, reproducible and semi-quantitative detection of phosphoproteins from individual mouse brain tissue homogenates and from cell fractionation and synaptosomal preparations of mouse hippocampus.


CONCLUSION
Alpha technology represents a major experimental step forward in unraveling the brain phosphoprotein-related molecular mechanisms involved in brain-related disorders."
66,Tingting Wang,"Epigenetic gene regulation shapes neuronal fate in the embryonic nervous system. Post-embryonically, epigenetic signaling within neurons has been associated with impaired learning, autism, ataxia, and schizophrenia. Epigenetic factors are also enriched in glial cells. However, little is known about epigenetic signaling in glia and nothing is known about the intersection of glial epigenetic signaling and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. During a screen for genes involved in presynaptic homeostatic synaptic plasticity, we identified an essential role for the histone acetyltransferase and deubiquitinase SAGA complex in peripheral glia. We present evidence that the SAGA complex is necessary for homeostatic plasticity, demonstrating involvement of four new genes in homeostatic plasticity. This is also evidence that glia participate in presynaptic homeostatic plasticity, invoking previously unexplored intercellular, homeostatic signaling at a tripartite synapse. We show, mechanistically, SAGA signaling regulates the composition of and signaling from the extracellular matrix during homeostatic plasticity."
232,Gregoris Komodikis,"BACKGROUND
Spine surgery rates have increased and the high postoperative morbidity in these patients result in increased costs. Consequently, it is essential to identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether preoperative Timed Up and Go (TUG) test performance can predict high-grade postoperative complications.


METHODS
A prospective cohort study of patients undergoing elective thoracolumbar spine surgery in a tertiary care hospital between 2017 and 2018. Patients were assessed preoperatively and assigned to the slow-TUG group if unable to perform or test performance time was ≥18.4 s. Primary outcome: high-grade postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes: overall complications, length of stay (LOS), discharge to healthcare facility, readmission and emergency department (ED) presentation. Patients were followed-up until 6 wk after surgery.


RESULTS
One hundred three patients (mean age 62.95 ± 10.97 yr) were enrolled. Slow-TUG group were more likely to be classified as American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) class 3 (74.1% vs 47.4%, P = .02), non-independent (25.9% vs 5.3%, P < .01), and frail (92.3% vs 42.1%, P < .01). TUG was an independent predictor of high-grade complications (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 4.97, 95% CI: 1.18-22.47), overall complications (OR: 3.77, 95% CI: 1.33-11.81), discharge to a skilled-nursing facility (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.00-10.70), readmission within 6 wk of surgery (OR: 9.14, 95% CI: 2.39-41.26) and LOS (adjusted incident rate ratio (IRR): 1.45, 95% CI: 1.16-1.80).


CONCLUSION
Compared to traditional risk factors, TUG is an important predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes and may be used preoperatively to identify high-risk thoracolumbar surgery patients."
93,Andrew H Dolinko,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of blindness for individuals under the age of 65. This loss of vision can be due to ischemia, neovascularization, and/or diabetic macular edema, which are caused by breakdown of the blood-retina barrier at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and inner retinal vasculature. The prevalence of diabetes and its complications differ between Caucasian-Americans and certain minority populations, such as African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Individuals can be classified by their mitochondrial haplogroups, which are collections of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) representing ancient geographic origins of populations. In this study, we compared the responses of diabetic human RPE cybrids, cell lines containing identical nuclei but mitochondria from either European (maternal European) or maternal African or Asian individuals, to hypoxia and high glucose levels. The African and Asian diabetic ([Afr+Asi]/DM) cybrids showed (1) resistance to both hyperglycemic and hypoxic stresses; (2) downregulation of pro-apoptotic indicator BAX; (3) upregulation of DNA methylation genes, such as DNMT3A and DNMT3B; and (4) resistance to DNA demethylation by the methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) compared to European diabetic (Euro/DM) cybrids. Our findings suggest that mitochondria from African and Asian diabetic subjects possess a ""metabolic memory"" that confers resistance against hyperglycemia, hypoxia, and demethylation, and that this ""metabolic memory"" can be transferred into the RPE cybrid cell lines in vitro."
810,Sied Kebir,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the role of olfactory function in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as a prognostic clinical measure.


METHODS
In a prospective case-control study, olfactory testing was performed in 73 patients with primary GBM at baseline during first-line treatment and at later follow-ups. An age-matched control cohort consisted of 49 patients with neurologic diseases, excluding those known to affect olfactory function per se. Depending on the olfactory testing score, patients were allotted to a hyposmia group (HG) or normosmia group (NG). MRI analysis was performed to assess whether tumor location affects olfactory pathways.


RESULTS
Patients with GBM had olfactory dysfunction significantly more often compared to the control cohort (p = 0.003). Tumor location could not explain this finding since no relevant difference in MRI-based olfactory pathway involvement was found between HG and NG (p = 0.131). Patients with olfactory dysfunction had significantly worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those without dysfunction (median OS 20.9 vs 40.6 months, p = 0.035; median PFS, 9 vs 19 months, p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis in patients without MRI-based involvement of olfactory pathways confirmed olfaction is an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43; p = 0.042) and PFS (HR 0.51; p = 0.049).


CONCLUSION
This pilot study provides the first indication that olfactory dysfunction is frequently observed in GBM and may be associated with worse survival outcome in GBM. However, validation of these results in an independent cohort is needed."
527,Francesco Sammartino,"INTRODUCTION
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). During DBS surgery, intraoperative testing is performed to confirm optimal lead placement by determining the stimulation thresholds for symptom improvement and side effects. However, the reliability of intraoperative testing in predicting distant postoperative thresholds is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that intraoperative testing reliably estimates postoperative thresholds for both symptom improvement and side effects.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed a prospective database with intraoperative and postoperative thresholds for symptom improvement and side effects from a cohort of 66 PD patients who underwent STN DBS. We recorded the stimulation locations relative to the mid-commissural point. Within-patient stimulation pairs were generated by clustering the intraoperative stimulation locations closest to the DBS contacts. We computed the distance between stimulation locations and atlas-based pyramidal tract (PT) and medial lemniscus (ML) masks. A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis was performed to determine the reliability of intraoperative testing in predicting postoperative thresholds while controlling for the distance from the relevant tracks.


RESULTS
Intraoperative testing reliably predicted (area under ROC >0.8) postoperative thresholds for tremor and rigidity improvements, as well as stimulation-induced motor contractions and paresthesias. The reliability was poor for improvement in bradykinesia.


CONCLUSION
Intraoperative testing reliably predicts postoperative thresholds. These results are relevant during the informed consent process and patient counseling for DBS surgery. These will also guide the development of future methods for intraoperative feedback, especially during asleep DBS."
650,Joanna Ciafone,"OBJECTIVES
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have substantial clinical and biological overlap, with cognitive deficits typically observed in the executive and visuospatial domains. However, the neuropsychological profiles of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) associated with these disorders are not well understood.


METHODS
This systematic review examined existing literature on cognition in MCI due to LB disease (MCI-LB) and PD (PD-MCI) using an electronic search of seven databases (Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and ScienceDirect). MCI-LB results were reviewed narratively given the small number of resulting papers (n = 7). Outcome variables from PD-MCI studies (n = 13) were extracted for meta-analysis of standardised mean differences (SMD).


RESULTS
In MCI-LB, executive dysfunction and slowed processing speed were the most prominent impairments, while visuospatial and working memory (WM) functions were also poor. MCI-LB scored significantly lower on verbal memory tests relative to controls, but significantly higher than patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease. Quantitative analysis of studies in PD-MCI showed a similar profile of impairment, with the largest deficits in visuospatial function (Benton Judgement of Line Orientation, SMD g = -2.09), executive function (Trail Making Test B, SMD g = -1.65), verbal ability (Naming Tests, SMD g = -0.140), and WM (Trail Making Test A, SMD g = -1.20). In both MCI-LB and PD-MCI, verbal and visuospatial memory retrieval was impaired, while encoding and storage appeared relatively intact.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this systematic review indicate similar neuropsychological profiles in the MCI stages of DLB and PDD. Executive impairment may at least partially explain poor performance in other domains."
223,Geoffrey Stanley,"The mammalian striatum is involved in many complex behaviors and yet is composed largely of a single neuron class: the spiny projection neuron (SPN). It is unclear to what extent the functional specialization of the striatum is due to the molecular specialization of SPN subtypes. We sought to define the molecular and anatomical diversity of adult SPNs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and quantitative RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). We computationally distinguished discrete versus continuous heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data and found that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four major discrete types with no implied spatial relationship between them. Within these discrete types, we find continuous heterogeneity encoding spatial gradients of gene expression and defining anatomical location in a combinatorial mechanism. Our results suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated, which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron."
950,Simona Pellacani,"Over the past 10 years, the increasingly important role played by next-generation sequencing panels in the genetic diagnosis of epilepsy has led to a growing list of gene variants and a plethora of new scientific data. To date, however, there is still no consensus on what constitutes the ""ideal panel design,"" or on the most rational criteria for selecting the best candidates for gene-panel analysis, even though both might optimize the cost-benefit ratio and the diagnostic efficiency of customized gene panels. Even though more and more laboratories are adopting whole-exome sequencing as a first-tier diagnostic approach, interpreting, ""in silico,"" a set of epilepsy-related genes remains difficult. In the light of these considerations, we performed a systematic review of the targeted gene panels for epilepsy already reported in the available scientific literature, with a view to identifying the best criteria for selecting patients for gene-panel analysis, and the best way to design an ""ideal,"" gold-standard panel that includes all genes with an established role in epilepsy pathogenesis, as well as those that might help to guide decisions regarding specific medical interventions and treatments. Our analyses suggest that the usefulness and diagnostic power of customized gene panels for epilepsy may be greatest when these panels are confined to rationally selected, relatively small, pools of genes, and applied in more carefully selected epilepsy patients (those with complex forms of epilepsy). A panel containing 64 genes, which includes the 45 genes harboring a significant number of pathogenic variants identified in previous literature, the 32 clinically actionable genes, and the 21 ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) recommended genes, may represent an ""ideal"" core set likely able to provide the highest diagnostic efficiency and cost-effectiveness and facilitate gene prioritization when testing patients with whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing."
1068,Belal Neyazi,"OBJECTIVES
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVM) are rare vascular lesions. Recent observations challenge the congenital nature of these lesions. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with dynamic changes of bAVM still remain unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the potential role of COL4A2 (Collagen alpha-2(IV)) in the pathophysiology of bAVM.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Expression and localization of COL4A2 were analyzed on tissue microarrays from bAVM patients (n = 60) by immunohistochemistry. Correlations between COL4A2 levels and clinical parameters were examined with Pearson's test for normally- distibuted or Spearman's Rho for not normally distributed data. Comparison between different clinical parameters was performed using t-test, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal- Wallis test. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data.


RESULTS
COL4A2 was mainly expressed beneath the endothelium of vessels in the tunica media of bAVM. This pattern of expression indicates the basement membrane of the vessel walls. High levels of COL4A2 expression correlated with the age at surgery of patients (p = 0.005; R = 0.393; Spearman's Rho). The age at surgery in young (17-25 years) and old patients (55-76 years) showed a linear correlation; a greater variance of COL4A2 expression was observed in the age group between 26-54 years.


CONCLUSION
This study reports for the first time the expression of COL4A2 in bAVM and suggests a potential role of COL4A2 in bAVM pathophysiology. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the microenvironment of bAVM and may foster the development of improved therapeutic strategies for this disease."
169,Satoko Koganemaru,"Although specific brain regions are important for regularly patterned limb movements, the rhythm generation system that governs bipedal locomotion in humans is not thoroughly understood. We investigated whether rhythmic transcranial brain stimulation over the cerebellum could alter walking rhythm. Fourteen healthy subjects performed over-ground walking for 10 min during which they were given, in a random order, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left cerebellum at the approximated frequency of their gait cycle, tACS over the skin of the scalp, and during sham stimulation. Cerebellar tACS showed a significant entrainment of gait rhythm compared with the control conditions. When the direction of the tACS currents was symmetrically inverted, some subjects showed entrainment at an approximately 180° inverted phase, suggesting that gait modulation is dependent on current orientation. These findings indicate that tACS over cerebellum can modulate gait generation system in cerebellum and become an innovative approach for the recovery of locomotion in patients with gait disturbances caused by CNS disorders."
704,Benjamin K Hendricks,"Large extramedullary-intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) within the spinal cord provide a unique management opportunity, compared with the cranial counterpart, in that the surgical morbidity can be minimized and surgical cure can still be achieved by resecting the extramedullary segment and leaving the intramedullary segment without invading the parenchyma. This management strategy minimizes morbidity and provides an excellent chance of surgical cure. This patient had a history of longstanding left hemiparesis since birth that progressed, prompting imaging evaluation that demonstrated a large cervical AVM with bilateral vertebral artery, anterior spinal artery, and left thyrocervical trunk feeding vessels. The AVM had both extramedullary and intramedullary components, making this a challenging lesion for microsurgical obliteration and preservation of neurological function. Preoperative embolization was utilized through the right vertebral artery pedicle. Microdissection was performed to isolate the extramedullary from the intramedullary component. Surgical cure was attempted for this patient by removing the extramedullary component and leaving the intramedullary segment. Indocyanine green fluoroscopy was used to isolate the feeding pedicle and guide surgical resection. Postoperative imaging demonstrated a small residual from the thyrocervical injection, which was obliterated with embolization. The patient improved neurologically within the postoperative period and regained ambulatory status during long-term follow-up. The patient gave informed consent for surgery and video recording. Institutional review board approval was deemed unnecessary. Used with permission from Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."
534,Abdul Rahman Almuneef,"BACKGROUND
Cerebral palsy (CP) is considered as the main cause of severe physical impairment and malnutrition in children. This cross-sectional study intended to survey the nutritional status of children cerebral palsy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.


METHODS
We examined 74 children (age: 1-10 yrs) with CP, who attended Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City (SBAHC), Riyadh Saudi Arabia. Data on age, general demographics, nutritional status, and dietary intake were collected. A child was considered underweight, wasted, stunted or thin if the standard deviation scores for his/her weight for age, weight for height, height for age and body mass index for age were ≤ -2.0 standard deviation (SD) using WHO growth standards. Multivariable logistic regression identified the factors associated with nutritional indicators.


RESULTS
More than half (56.4%) of the children with cerebral palsy were malnourished as they had z-score below <-2 SD in at least one of the four indicators. Thinness (50%) was the most common form of malnutrition, followed by underweight, stunting, and wasting. Arm anthropometrics gave similar results on the percent number of malnourished children. Factors that were independently associated with malnutrition with an adjusted OR (aOR) were as follow: age ≤ 5 yrs. (aOR: 4.29); presence of cognitive impairment (aOR: 4.13); presence of anemia (aOR: 3.41) and inadequate energy intake (aOR: 4.86) (p, for all trends <0.05).


CONCLUSION
Children with cerebral palsy of the current study have impaired growth and nutritional status as assessed by all four common nutritional status indicators. Further large-scale community-based studies for in-depth evaluation of nutritional status and growth patterns in children with CP are needed."
1043,Victoria C Seghatol-Eslami,"Deficits in social communication in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been documented using neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI over the past decade. More recently, functional connectivity MRI has revealed altered connectivity in face processing, mentalizing, and mirroring brain networks, networks involved in the social brain in ASD. However, to our knowledge, previous studies have not examined these three networks concurrently. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the functional connectivity of the face processing, mentalizing, and mirroring networks (within each network and across networks) in ASD during an action-intention task in which participants were asked to determine the means and intention of a model's actions. We examined: a) within-network connectivity of each network using an ROI-to-ROI analysis; b) connectivity of each network hub to the rest of the brain using a seed-to-voxel analysis; c) the between-network connectivity of each network hub using ROI-to-ROI analysis; and d) brain-behavior relationships by correlating autism symptoms with brain connectivity. Task-fMRI data were used from 21 participants with ASD and 20 typically developing participants. The ASD group consistently showed significantly greater connectivity between networks and between hub regions to the rest of the brain. Hyperconnectivity in ASD may entail more and widespread resource utilization for accomplishing action-intention judgment."
53,Mary H Burleson,"John Cacioppo and colleagues' Somatovisceral Afference Model of Emotion (SAME) highlighted the importance of interoception in emotional experience. Here we compare how the SAME and the more recent Theory of Constructed Emotion (TCE) view the role of interoceptive signals in creating emotional experiences. We describe the characteristics of touch sensations that are carried by thin, unmyelinated fibers called C-tactile afferents (CTs) to the posterior insula, and are thus deemed interoceptive despite their typically social (external) origin. We explore how this social interoceptive input might contribute to the emotion-related effects of social touch more generally, and speculate that all social touch, with or without CT afferent stimulation, can directly influence allostasis, or the predictive regulation of short- and long-term energy resources required by the body. Finally, we describe several features of CT-optimal touch that make it a potentially useful tool to help illuminate basic interoceptive mechanisms, emotion-related phenomena, and disorders involving atypical affect or somatosensation. These proposed ideas demonstrate the long intellectual reach of John Cacioppo and Gary Berntson's highly productive scientific collaboration, which was formative for the fields of social neuroscience, social psychophysiology, and affective neuroscience."
482,Janet M Duchek,"OBJECTIVES
The present study explored relationships among personality, Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, and dementia by addressing the following questions: (1) Does personality discriminate healthy aging and earliest detectable stage of AD? (2) Does personality predict conversion from healthy aging to early-stage AD? (3) Do AD biomarkers mediate any observed relationships between personality and dementia status/conversion?


METHODS
Both self- and informant ratings of personality were obtained in a large well-characterized longitudinal sample of cognitively normal older adults (N = 436) and individuals with early-stage dementia (N = 74). Biomarkers included amyloid imaging, hippocampal volume, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42, and CSF tau.


RESULTS
Higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, along with all four biomarkers strongly discriminated cognitively normal controls from early-stage AD individuals. The direct effects of neuroticism and conscientiousness were only mediated by hippocampal volume. Conscientiousness along with all biomarkers predicted conversion from healthy aging to early-stage AD; however, none of the biomarkers mediated the relationship between conscientiousness and conversion. Conscientiousness predicted conversion as strongly as the biomarkers, with the exception of hippocampal volume.


CONCLUSIONS
Conscientiousness and to a lesser extent neuroticism serve as important independent behavioral markers for AD risk."

Protocols for intraoperative language mapping with direct electrical stimulation (DES) often include various language tasks triggering both nouns and verbs in sentences. Such protocols are not readily available for navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), where only single word object naming is generally used. Here, we present the development, norming, and standardization of the verb and noun test for peri-operative testing (VAN-POP) that measures language skills more extensively.


METHODS
The VAN-POP tests noun and verb retrieval in sentence context. Items are marked and balanced for several linguistic factors known to influence word retrieval. The VAN-POP was administered in English, German, and Dutch under conditions that are used for nTMS and DES paradigms. For each language, 30 speakers were tested.


RESULTS
At least 50 items per task per language were named fluently and reached a high naming agreement.


CONCLUSION
The protocol proved to be suitable for pre- and intraoperative language mapping with nTMS and DES."

The ""double flap"" reconstruction technique, comprised of a simultaneous vascularized pedicled pericranial flap (PCF) and pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF), can be used to repair anterior skull base defects after a combined cranionasal or transbasal-endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been performed to remove malignant anterior skull base tumors. The use of two vascularized flaps may potentially decrease the incidence of post-radiation flap necrosis and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks after radiation therapy.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of a prospective skull base database on patients who underwent the double flap reconstruction technique after a combined transbasal-EEA approach. Data collected for each patient included demographics, method of tumor resection and repair, complications, tumor recurrence, and follow-up.


RESULTS
Nine patients who underwent a combined transbasal-EEA approach for resection of anterior skull base tumors with significant intracranial extension followed by reconstruction of the cranial base using the double flap technique. Four were men and five were women, with a mean age of 49 years (range, 15-68 years). There was no postoperative CSF leakage detected or complications of infection, meningitis, mucocele, or tension pneumocephalus after a mean follow-up of 35.7 months (range, 4.5-98 months). Seven of the nine patients underwent adjuvant radiation without flap necrosis. Local tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the patients at last follow-up; however, one patient developed distant brain metastasis.


CONCLUSION
The simultaneous PCF and NSF double flap reconstruction is an effective technique in preventing postoperative CSF leakage and post-radiation necrosis when repairing anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal-EEA approaches. This technique may be useful in patients anticipated to undergo postoperative radiation therapy."
920,T George Hornby,"BACKGROUND
Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.


METHODS
A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.


RESULTS
Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality-based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality-based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight-supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.


DISCUSSION
The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.


LIMITATIONS
As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.


SUMMARY
The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.


DISCLAIMER
These recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to improve walking speed and distance."
670,Lue Zhou,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the associations of sleep duration, midday napping, sleep quality, and change in sleep duration with risk of incident stroke and stroke subtypes.


METHODS
Among 31,750 participants aged 61.7 years on average at baseline from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, we used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke.


RESULTS
Compared with sleeping 7 to <8 hours/night, those reporting longer sleep duration (≥9 hours/night) had a greater risk of total stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.41), while shorter sleep (<6 hours/night) had no significant effect on stroke risk. The HR (95% CI) of total stroke was 1.25 (1.03-1.53) for midday napping >90 minutes vs 1-30 minutes. The results were similar for ischemic stroke. Compared with good sleep quality, those with poor sleep quality showed a 29%, 28%, and 56% higher risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Moreover, we observed significant joint effects of sleeping ≥9 hours/night and midday napping >90 minutes (HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.28-2.66), and sleeping ≥9 hours/night and poor sleep quality (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.33-2.48) on risk of total stroke. Furthermore, compared with persistently sleeping 7-9 hours/night, those who persistently slept ≥9 hours/night or switched from 7 to 9 hours to ≥9 hours/night had a higher risk of total stroke.


CONCLUSIONS
Long sleep duration, long midday napping, and poor sleep quality were independently and jointly associated with higher risks of incident stroke. Persistently long sleep duration or switch from average to long sleep duration increased the risk of stroke."

Evolution of endoscopic surgery provides equivalent results to open surgery with advantages of minimal invasive surgery. The literature on technique Uniportal Full endoscopic contralateral approach is scarce.


METHODS
The endoscopic contralateral approach technique applies for patients presenting with double crush syndrome with foraminal and extraforminal stenosis. The key steps focus on contralateral ventral overriding superior articular process decompression, foraminal and extraforaminal discectomy, and lateral vertebral syndesmophyte decompression leading to enlargement of the contralateral foramen and extraforamen size.


CONCLUSION
The Uniportal Full endoscopic contralateral approach is a good alternative to open surgery or minimally invasive microscopic surgery through direct endoscopic visualization of the entire route of exiting nerve with no neural retraction allowing both lateral recess and foraminal and extraforaminal decompression all in one approach."
1142,Michael Wong,"BACKGROUND
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterized by severe neurological manifestations, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and a range of other behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, collectively referred to as TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND). Various tumors and hamartomas affecting different organs are the pathological hallmarks of the disease, especially cortical tubers of the brain, but specific cellular and molecular abnormalities, such as involving the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, have been identified that also cause or contribute to neurological manifestations of TSC independent of gross structural lesions. In particular, while neurons are immediate mediators of neurological symptoms, different types of glial cells have been increasingly recognized to play important roles in the phenotypes of TSC.


MAIN BODY
This review summarizes the literature supporting glial dysfunction from both mouse models and clinical studies of TSC. In particular, evidence for the role of astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and TAND in TSC is analyzed. Therapeutic implications of targeting glia cells in developing novel treatments for the neurological manifestations of TSC are also considered.


CONCLUSIONS
Different types of glial cells have both cell autonomous effects and interactions with neurons and other cells that are involved in the pathophysiology of the neurological phenotype of TSC. Targeting glial-mediated mechanisms may represent a novel therapeutic approach for epilepsy and TAND in TSC patients."

Since acute fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vascular hyperintensity (FVH) is indicative of disordered blood flow, FVH is considered a marker of acute major arterial occlusion. Conversely, the role of the absence of FVH (negative-FVH) remains unknown.


METHODS
Consecutive stroke patients were studied via magnetic resonance angiography, within 24 h of onset and major arterial occlusion. All patients were examined using serial angiography to evaluate the presence of recanalization. Patients were classified into negative-FVH and positive-FVH groups.


RESULTS
A total of 72 patients (49 [68%] male patients, aged 76 [66-83] years) were enrolled. Ten patients were allocated to the negative-FVH group and 62 to the positive-FVH group. Initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 4 (2-8) in the negative-FVH group and 10 (4-21) in the positive-FVH group (p = 0.012). Recanalization was achieved in 1 (10%) of the 10 patients in the negative-FVH group and in 49 (79%) of the 62 patients in the positive-FVH group during hospitalization (p < 0.001). Patients with recanalization were older (p = 0.023), had higher NIHSS score (p = 0.008), were admitted earlier (p = 0.014), exhibited a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.010) and anterior circulation occlusion (p = 0.021), and were more frequently treated with hyperacute recanalization therapy (p = 0.004). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that negative-FVH (odds ratio 0.087, 95% confidential interval [0.008-0.988], p = 0.049) was a negative independent factor associated with recanalization during hospitalization.


CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, negative-FVH in acute stroke was associated with lack of recanalization during hospitalization."

The choice of surgical approaches and options for the microsurgical vertebral artery (VA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms repair remains controversial.


Methods
A retrospective analysis of the clinical, surgical, and angiographic data of 80 patients with VA and PICA aneurysms treated from 2012 to 2018 was performed.


Results
The aneurysms were saccular in 50 cases (62.5%) and fusiform in 30 cases (37.5%). The median suboccipital craniotomy was the most common approach (73.8%). Retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed in 25% of patients. There were the following types of microsurgical operations: neck clipping (61.25%), clipping with the artery lumen formation (13.75%), trapping (10%), proximal clipping (5%), and deconstruction with anastomosis (10%). Fifty-seven (71.3%) patients were discharged without worsening of the clinical signs after surgery. The most common postoperative neurological disorder was palsy of IX and X cranial nerve revealed in 14 (17.5%) patients. No fatal outcomes or patients in vegetative state were identified. The complete occlusion of PICA and VA aneurysms according angiography was in 77 (96.3%) cases.


Conclusion
Microsurgical treatment is an effective method for VA and PICA aneurysms. The majority of VA and PICA aneurysms do not require complex basal approaches. A thorough preoperative planning, reconstructive clipping techniques, and anastomoses creation, as well as patient selection based on the established algorithms and consultations with endovascular surgeons, may reduce the number of complications and increase the rate of complete microsurgical occlusion in VA and PICA aneurysms."

805,Marion A Deroche,"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a mesocorticolimbic structure that integrates cognitive, emotional and motor functions. Although its role in psychiatric disorders is widely acknowledged, the understanding of its circuitry is not complete. Here we combined optogenetic and whole-cell recordings to draw a functional portrait of excitatory disambiguated synapses onto D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the adult male mouse NAc core. Comparing synaptic properties of ventral hippocampus (vHipp), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) inputs revealed a hierarchy of synaptic inputs that depends on the identity of the postsynaptic target MSN. Thus, the BLA is the dominant excitatory pathway onto D1 MSNs (BLA > PFC = vHipp) while PFC inputs dominate D2 MSNs (PFC > vHipp > BLA). We also tested the hypothesis that endocannabinoids endow excitatory circuits with pathway- and cell-specific plasticity. Thus, while CB1 receptors (CB1R) uniformly depress excitatory pathways irrespective of MSNs identity, TRPV1 receptors (TRPV1R) bidirectionally control inputs onto the NAc core in a pathway-specific manner. Finally, we show that the interplay of TRPV1R/CB1R shapes plasticity at BLA-NAc synapses. Together these data shed new light on synapse and circuit specificity in the adult NAc core and illustrate how endocannabinoids contribute to pathway-specific synaptic plasticity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe examined the impact of connections from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp,) basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) onto identified medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the adult accumbens core. We found BLA inputs were strongest at D1 MSNs while PFC inputs dominate D2 MSNs. Pathway- and cell-specific circuit control was also facilitated by endocannabinoids that endow bidirectional synaptic plasticity at identified BLA-NAc synapses. These data provide mechanistic insights on synapse and circuit specificity in the adult NAc core."

We prospectively evaluated the concordance between neurology assessment of suitability to drive (pass/fail) and OTDA in 41 individuals with brain metastases. Neuro-oncology evaluation included an interview and neurological examination. Participants subsequently underwent OTDA during which a battery of objective measures of visual, cognitive, and motor skills related to driving was administered.


Results
The mean age of patients who failed OTDA was age 68.9 years vs 59.3 years in the group members who passed (P = .0046). The sensitivity of the neurology assessment to predict driving fitness compared with OTDA was 16.1% and the specificity 90%. The 31 patients who failed OTDA were more likely to fail Vision Coach, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Trail Making B tests.


Conclusions
There was poor association between the assessment of suitability to drive by neurologists and the outcome of the OTDA in patients with brain metastases. Subtle deficits that may impair the ability to drive safely may not be evident on neurologic examination. The positive predictive value was high to predict OTDA failure. Age could be a factor affecting OTDA performance. The results raise questions about the choice of assessments in making recommendations about driving fitness in people with brain metastases. OTDA should be strongly considered in patients with brain metastases who wish to continue driving."
472,Chenhao Zhang,"Background and Objective: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a serious condition that is often called a warning stroke. The risk of cerebral infarction in patients with TIA and positive DWI findings is greater than that in patients with TIA and normal DWI findings. Butylphthalide injection is a new type of brain protective drug. The study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of butylphthalide injection for treating TIA as shown by DWI abnormality progressing to infarction.Methods: We studied 98 patients with positive DWI findings among 260 patients with TIA, and randomly divided into the experimental (treatment with butylphthalide injection) and control (treatment with aspirin) groups. The number of cerebral infarctions in the two groups was recorded on 7th, 14th, 30th, and 90th day, and adverse reactions were observed. The number of cerebral infarctions was compared among the different ABCD2 scores of patients with TIA and positive DWI findings.Results: The incidence of cerebral infarction in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of cerebral infarction with an ABCD2 score less than 3 points was significantly lower than that with an ABCD2 score of more than 3 points (P < 0.05), with less adverse reactions.Conclusion: Butylphthalide injection is helpful and safe for preventing stroke following TIA, and treating TIA with positive DWI and progression to infarction."
734,Zhi-Xia Kang,"Nemaline myopathy (NEM) is a congenital myopathy that typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and hypotonia. To date, 13 genes have been associated with NEM. The Kelch repeat and BTB domain-containing protein 13 (KBTBD13) gene (KBTBD13)-related NEM is a rarely reported condition, and not a single case has been reported in Asia. Here, we report the case of a mother and daughter in China with NEM caused by a mutation (c.1222C>T) in KBTBD13. Their shared clinical phenotype is symmetrical muscle weakness in the arms and legs with childhood onset. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed the unique replacement mode of muscle with fibro-fatty tissue. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of fibers containing rod-shaped structures in the cytoplasm or under the sarcolemma. DNA sequencing analysis detected a heterozygous mutation (c.1222C>T) in KBTBD13 in this family. A founder effect for the variant may exist in the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, and the mutation may be a hotspot mutation in Europe, as it has not been reported in Asia. Our case study expands the spectrum of KBTBD13-related NEM."
504,Anastasia Bougea,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the possible association between salivary CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, depression/anxiety and migraine, and tension type headache (TTH) in saliva of these patients.


METHOD
A longitudinal prospective study was conducted on 30 migraineurs, 30 TTH patients, and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Anxiety and depression were measured by using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Salivary IL-6, IL-1β, and CRP were collected in distinct time points as A: headache-free period, B: during headache, C: 1 day after headache attack, and measured by using ELISA kits.


RESULTS
No significant differences were found in time variation of CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels between migraine and TTH (p > 0.05). IL1-β had the highest discriminative value (area under the curve = 0.924, p value < 0.001), and then CRP (area under the curve = 0.763, p value < 0.001) and IL-6 (area under the curve = 0.537, p value = 0.58). CRP and IL-6 were negatively correlated with HAM-A and BDI scores.


CONCLUSION
IL1-β had the highest discriminative value between headache patients and controls compared with CRP and IL-6. CRP and IL-6 were correlated with lower symptom scores of anxiety and depression prior or immediately after the headache period in patients groups."
547,Ankita Salvi,"Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a major contributor to global air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that air pollution due to gasoline and diesel emissions from internal combustion engines of automobiles, trucks, locomotives, and ships leads to 800,000 premature deaths annually due to pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological complications. It has been observed that individuals living and working in areas of heavy vehicle traffic have high susceptibility to anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. Information regarding the mechanisms that potentially lead to detrimental mental health effects of TRAP is gradually increasing. Several studies have suggested that TRAP is associated with adverse effects in the central nervous system (CNS), primarily due to increase in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Animal studies have provided further useful insights on the deleterious effects of vehicle exhaust emissions (VEEs). The mechanistic basis for these effects is unclear, although gasoline and diesel exhaust-induced neurotoxicity seems the most plausible cause. Several important points emerge from these studies. First, TRAP leads to neurotoxicity. Second, TRAP alters neurobehavioral function. Exactly how that happens remains unclear. This review article will discuss current state of the literature on this subject and potential leads that have surfaced from the preclinical work."
253,Abhishek Pathak,"Intracerebral pneumocephalus is commonly associated with head and facial trauma, ear infection, tumors and surgical interventions. Osteomas are relatively common, benign tumors that occur mainly in the paranasal sinuses, the frontal sinus in particular. Pneumocephalus has been commonly reported with frontal osteoma but isolated presentation as frontotemporal dementia is uncommon. Patient was admitted with complaints of change of behavior and forgetfulness for the last one year. He had progressively become more apathetic and presented with behavioral abnormalities. General physical examinations were within normal limits including the motor and sensory system although neuropsychiatry assessments were below the average level, with features of dementia. Further, MRI brain revealed pneumocephalus in bilateral frontal lobe. CT cisternography revealed a well defined lobulated densely sclerotic lesion of approximate size 20 × 17 × 27mm transverse and cranio-caudal axis respectively arising from right ethmoid sinus. Clinically, the association of pneumocephalus and isolated presentation as frontotemporal dementia has not been described to the best of our knowledge. A single case has been described with ethmoid osteoma. Radiological features were suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The uniqueness of the case is the development of dementia with frontotemporal involvement and resemblance with Frontotemporal Dementia. This is the only case with dementia and pneumocephalus (secondary to osteoid osteoma) to best of our knowledge."
776,Johannes Kohl,"Parenting is essential for survival and wellbeing in many species. Since it can be performed with little prior experience and entails considerable sacrifices without immediate benefits for the caregiver, this behavior is likely orchestrated by evolutionarily shaped, hard-wired neural circuits. At the same time, experience, environmental factors and internal state also make parenting highly malleable. These characteristics have made parenting an attractive paradigm for linking complex, naturalistic behavior to its underlying neural mechanisms. Recent work - based on the identification of critical neuronal populations and improved tools for dissecting neural circuits - has uncovered novel functional principles and challenged simplistic models of parenting control. A better understanding of the neural basis of parenting will provide crucial clues to how complex behaviors are organized at the level of cells, circuits and computations. Here I review recent progress, discuss emerging functional principles of parental circuits, and outline future opportunities and challenges."
788,Ya-Ni Zhang,"BACKGROUND
X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) is a rare inherited primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by the B cell developmental defect, caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may cause serious recurrent infections. The diagnosis of XLA is sometimes challenging because a few number of patients have higher levels of serum immunoglobulins than expected. In this study, we reported an atypical case with recurrent meningitis, delayed diagnosis with XLA by genetic analysis at the second episode of meningitis at the age of 8 years.


CASE REPORT
An 8-year-old Chinese boy presented with fever, dizziness and recurrent vomiting for 3 days. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were suggestive of bacterial meningoencephalitis, despite the negative gram staining and cultures of the CSF. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and responded well to the treatment. He had history of another episode of acute pneumococci meningitis 4 years before. The respective level of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 4.85 g/L, 0.93 g/L and 0.1 g/L at 1st episode, whereas 1.9 g/L, 0.27 g/L and 0 g/L at second episode. The B lymphocytes were 0.21 and 0.06% of peripheral blood lymphocytes at first and second episode respectively. Sequencing of the BTK coding regions showed that the patient had a point mutation in the intron 14, hemizyous c.1349 + 5G > A, while his mother had a heterozygous mutation. It was a splice site mutation predicted to lead to exon skipping and cause a truncated BTK protein.


CONCLUSION
Immunity function should be routinely checked in patients with severe intracranial bacterial infection. Absence of B cells even with normal level of serum immunoglobulin suggests the possibility of XLA, although this happens only in rare instances. Mutational analysis of BTK gene is crucial for accurate diagnosis to atypical patients with XLA."

This paper summarises the discussion in a think tank at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) 2018 about the treatment of bladder pain syndrome.


AIMS
To review the treatments of bladder pain syndrome from behavioural treatments to surgical interventions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Review the literature in the light of the think tank discussions.


RESULTS
All guidelines recommend different levels of treatment starting with conservative behavioral treatments then introducing oral treatments followed by intravesical instillations. If these treatments fail then more invasive treatments such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, or surgery could be suggested.


CONCLUSION
Unfortunately for all treatments, the numbers are limited and, therefore, the evidence base is not strong. Further suggestions for research are suggested."
375,Keith G Heinzerling,"Methamphetamine (MA) triggers neuroinflammation and medications that counteract MA-induced neuroinflammation may reduce MA-induced neurodegeneration and improve neurocognition and treatment outcomes in MA use disorder. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the safety and efficacy of ibudilast (IBUD), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that reduces neuroinflammation, for the treatment of MA use disorder. Treatment-seeking volunteers with MA use disorder were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of IBUD 50 mg twice daily (N = 64) or placebo (N = 61) with medication management counseling. Participants visited the outpatient research clinic twice weekly to provide urine specimens for drug screens and undergo study assessments. The primary outcome was end of treatment MA-abstinence (EOTA) during weeks 11 and 12 of treatment. Serum IBUID levels were measured for IBUD participants during week 3 of treatment. There was no difference in EOTA for IBUD (14%) versus placebo (16%, p > 0.05). There was no correlation between serum IBUD levels and MA use during treatment and mean IBUD levels for participants with (mean = 51.3, SD = 20.3) and without (mean = 54.7, SD = 33.0, p = 0.70) EOTA. IBUD was well tolerated. IBUD did not facilitate MA abstinence in this outpatient trial. Whether targeting neuroinflammation, either with IBUD in other subgroups of MA users or clinical trial designs, or with other anti-inflammatory medications, is an effective strategy for treating MA use disorder is not clear.

8,Ricardo Piña,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent psychiatric childhood disorder, characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and impaired attention, treated most frequently with methylphenidate (MPH). For children and adults with ADHD who do not respond satisfactorily or do not tolerate well stimulants such as MPH or D-Amphetamine, for them the alternative is to use Atomoxetine (ATX), a norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor that increase extracellular NE. We examined the effects of ATX on behavior and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the murine prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) model of ADHD. ADHD symptoms were measured using behavioral tests, open field for hyperactivity and the Y-maze for spatial working memory. Further, ATX effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices at the CA3-CA1 synapse were assessed. PNE mice exhibited the behavioral deficits of ADHD, hyperactivity and spatial memory impairment. Intraperitoneal injection of ATX (2 mg/kg/day) normalized these behaviors significantly after 7 days. In PNE mice LTP was reduced (110.6 ± 4.5% %; n = 7) compared to controls (148.9 ± 5.2%; n = 7; p < 0.05). ATX administration (5 µM) reestablished the LTP in PNE mice to levels similar to the controls (157.7 ± 6.3%; n = 7). Paired-pulse ratios (PPR) were not significantly different for any condition. These results indicate that administration of ATX in a PNE model of ADHD reestablishes TBS-dependent LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses. The results suggest postsynaptic changes in synaptic plasticity as part of the mechanisms that underlie improvement of ADHD symptoms induced by ATX."
997,Miguel Oliveira Santos,"Sarcoglycanopathies are a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) caused by mutations in sarcoglycan genes. We report a Portuguese patient with a very late-onset LGMD phenotype, whose muscle biopsy and immunostaining, in particular for α-sarcoglycan, were unrevealing. Muscle MRI showed a predominant, bilateral and symmetric involvement of the tight muscles and also, to a lesser extent, of the posterior compartment of lower legs muscles. Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a known homozygous c.850C > T (p.Arg284Cys) mutation in SGCA gene. Milder forms of α-sarcoglycanopathies could be a challenging diagnosis; particularly if muscle histopathology and α-sarcoglycan immunohistochemistry are unhelpful. NGS plays a crucial role not only for aiding in the establishment of a definite diagnosis, but also for expanding clinical presentations."
976,Minghao Wang,"OBJECTIVE
Both structural allograft and PEEK have been used for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). There are reports that PEEK has a higher pseudarthrosis rate than structural allograft. The authors compared pseudarthrosis, revision, subsidence, and loss of lordosis rates in patients with PEEK and structural allograft.


METHODS
The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who were treated with ACDF at their hospital between 2005 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with either PEEK or structural allograft, anterior plate fixation, and a minimum 2-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria were hybrid PEEK and allograft cases, additional posterior surgery, adjacent corpectomies, infection, tumor, stand-alone or integrated screw and cage devices, bone morphogenetic protein use, or lack of a minimum 2-year follow-up. Demographic variables, number of treated levels, interbody type (PEEK cage vs structural allograft), graft packing material, pseudarthrosis rates, revision surgery rates, subsidence, and cervical lordosis changes were collected. These data were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test, according to the sample size and expected value) and Student t-test.


RESULTS
A total of 168 patients (264 levels total, mean follow-up time 39.5 ± 24.0 months) were analyzed. Sixty-one patients had PEEK, and 107 patients had structural allograft. Pseudarthrosis rates for 1-level fusions were 5.4% (PEEK) and 3.4% (allograft) (p > 0.05); 2-level fusions were 7.1% (PEEK) and 8.1% (allograft) (p > 0.05); and ≥ 3-level fusions were 10% (PEEK) and 11.1% (allograft) (p > 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the subsidence magnitude between PEEK and allograft in 1-, 2-, and ≥ 3-level ACDF (p > 0.05). Postoperative lordosis loss was not different between cohorts for 1- and 2-level surgeries.


CONCLUSIONS
In 1- and 2-level ACDF with plating involving the same number of fusion levels, there was no statistically significant difference in the pseudarthrosis rate, revision surgery rate, subsidence, and lordosis loss between PEEK cages and structural allograft."
854,Catherine Butz,"Objective: Conversion disorder has a significant impact on families and the healthcare system. A recent review suggests there is little uniformity in treating this population. This paper describes an inpatient treatment program emphasizing physical conditioning and less time uncovering the psychological underpinnings of the presentation. Design: This study included 100 pediatric patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation setting with lower extremity weakness/dysfunction not explained by a medical cause. Patients followed a 16-step goal hierarchy to increase physical function. Patients participated in three hours of therapy and met with a psychologist and teacher daily. Patient functioning was assessed at three time periods using the mobility items of the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Results: Ninety-four patients completed the program. The average length of stay was 10 days. There were no significant differences between gender, length of stay, or insurance. Data was collected from 73 participants at a two-month follow-up. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), using time points at admission, discharge, and follow-up, revealed significant improvements over time. Post-hoc contrasts showed differences with admission and discharge but no differences between discharge and follow-up, suggesting gains in mobility remained. Conclusion: This paper describes an inpatient program that effectively treats patients with conversion disorder in a relatively short period. The physical gains made during hospitalization persisted over time and suggest inpatient rehabilitation focusing on physical mobility could be a more financially beneficial approach than outpatient treatment. Future considerations include identifying a more robust assessment process for patients to determine other psychological characteristics that might impact successful, more short-term treatment."
162,Md Razib Hossain,"MDGA1 (MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor) has recently been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Dysregulation of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems has long been associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we measured prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response and ex vivo tissue content of monoamines and their metabolites in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus of Mdga1 homozygous (Mdga1-KO), Mdga1 heterozygous (Mdga1-HT) and wild-type (WT) male mice. We found that Mdga1-KO mice exhibited statistically significant impairment of PPI, and had higher levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) in all three brain regions studied compared with Mdga1-HT and WT mice (P < 0.05), while levels of norepinephrine, DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-methoxytyramine remained unchanged. Mdga1-KO mice also had a lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in the striatum (P < 0.05) compared with WT mice. 5-HT levels remained unchanged with the exception of a significant increase in the level in the cortex. These data are the first evidence suggesting that MDGA1 deficiency leads to a pronounced deficit in PPI and plays an important role in perturbation of DA and 5-HT metabolism in mouse brain; such changes may contribute to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders."
923,Alessia Rubini,"OBJECTIVES
The stapedius muscle, tendon, and pyramidal eminence are structures within the retrotympanum. In cholesteatoma surgery, the retrotympanum is a common site of residual disease. The removal of the pyramidal eminence during surgery is sometimes necessary to obtain better visualization of the superior retrotympanum during surgery. Understanding the relational anatomy of structures in the region to the facial nerve allows the surgeon to safely access regional disease. This study aims to better understand the anatomical relationship between the mastoid portion of the facial nerve, the pyramidal eminence, and the stapedius muscle. A secondary aim is to demonstrate that removal of the stapedius muscle in the cadaver model, can increase exposure to the retrotympanic space.


STUDY DESIGN
Anatomical cadaveric observation study.


METHODS
Endoscopic dissection of cadaveric heads was undertaken. Classification of the superior and inferior retrotympanic area was performed. The anatomy of the stapedius muscle was described including relationships, depth, course, and angle with respect to the facial nerve. The pyramidal eminence and stapedius muscle were removed in all specimens and the exposure of the retrotympanum re-evaluated to determine if exposure of the region was increased.


RESULTS
In all cases (11 ears), the stapedius muscle was located medial and anterior to the mastoid portion of the facial nerve, with the second genu superior. The mean antero-posterior distance from the apex of the pyramidal eminence, which the stapedius tendon enters, to the stapes itself was 4.10 mm (range, 2.92-5.73 mm; standard deviation [SD] 0.90 mm). In all cases, irrespective of sinus tympani conformation, removal of the pyramidal eminence and stapedial bony crest in proximity to the facial nerve allowed exposure of the whole retrotympanic region, using a 0-degree endoscope.


CONCLUSIONS
The pyramidal eminence and stapedius muscle have a relatively constant relationship to the facial nerve. Removal of the stapedius muscle in the human cadaver model increases the exposure of the sinus tympani and subpyramidal space. Increased visualization in this region, may reduce risk of residual cholesteatoma in patients."
36,Anthony M Tonsbeek,"OBJECTIVE
Aberrant vertebral artery loops are a rare clinical condition, with sparse data regarding the optimal treatment guidelines for individual patients. The heterogeneity of treatment options in the current literature creates a problem when tailoring treatments to individual patients. In this review of the literature, multiple surgical treatments for cervical vertebral artery loops were analysed and compared. In addition, this article provides a clinical case of a patient with a vertebral artery loop.


METHODS
A literature review was conducted to identify studies investigating surgical treatments for a vertebral artery loop. Different surgical techniques were examined and the involved techniques and approaches described. The outcomes were assessed for each study and the effectiveness of the treatment determined.


RESULTS
Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Six types of surgical interventions were found in the literature. Each intervention had similar postoperative results, leading to either a significant improvement or a complete resolution of symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Multiple successful surgical interventions have been described in the medical literature. However, due to the lack of evidence-based studies, no surgical intervention protocol could be determined. Treatment should therefore be tailored to individual patient's characteristics. Since not every radiologically detected VA loop is the main culprit for a patient's complaints, a thorough multidisciplinary approach is justified and advocated in patients with an atypical presentation, before a neurosurgical intervention takes place. More deliberate clinical decisions can be made once the understanding of the pathogenesis of this rare disease entity has been established and treatment protocols formulated."
963,Haiteng Jiang,"It is well-established that theta (∼4 - 10 Hz) and gamma (∼25 - 100 Hz) oscillations interact in the rat hippocampus. This cross-frequency coupling might facilitate neuronal coordination both within and between brain areas. However, it remains unclear whether the phase of theta oscillations controls the power of slow and fast gamma activity or vice versa. We here applied spectral Granger causality, phase-slope index and a newly developed cross-frequency directionality (CFD) measure to investigate directional interactions between local field potentials recorded within and across hippocampal subregions of CA1 and CA3 of freely exploring rats. Given the well-known CA3 o CA1 anatomical connection, we hypothesized that interregional directional interactions were constrained by anatomical connection, and within-frequency and cross-frequency directional interactions were always from CA3 to CA1. As expected, we found that CA3 drove CA1 in the theta band, and theta phase to gamma power coupling was prominent both within and between CA3 and CA1 regions. The CFD measure further demonstrated distinct directional couplings with respect to theta phase that was different between slow and fast gamma activity. Importantly, CA3 slow gamma power phase adjusted CA1 theta oscillations, suggesting that slow gamma activity in CA3 entrains theta oscillations in CA1. In contrast, CA3 theta phase controls CA1 fast gamma activity, indicating that communication at fast gamma is coordinated by theta phase. Overall, these findings demonstrate dynamic directional interactions between theta and slow/fast gamma oscillations in the hippocampal network, suggesting that anatomical connections constrain the directional interactions."
531,Jenny L Wilson,"BACKGROUND
Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration is characterized by severe, progressive dystonia. This study aims to describe the reported usage of cannabis products among children with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, 37-item survey was distributed in April 2019 to the families of 44 children who participate in a clinical registry of individuals with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.


RESULTS
We received 18 responses (40.9% response rate). Children were a mean of 11.0 (SD 4.3) years old. The 15 respondents with dystonia or spasticity were on a median of 2 tone medications (range 0-9). Seven children had ever used cannabis (38.9%). The most common source of information about cannabis was other parents. Children who had ever used cannabis were on more tone medications, were more likely to have used opiates, were less likely to be able to roll, and less likely to sit comfortably, than children who had never used cannabis. Four children reported moderate or significant improvement in dystonia with cannabis. Other areas reported to be moderate or significantly improved were pain (n = 3), sleep (n = 4), anxiety (n = 3), and behavior (n = 2). Adverse effects included sadness (n = 1), agitation/behavior change (n = 1), and tiredness (n = 1).


CONCLUSION
Cannabis use was commonly reported among children with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration whose parents responded to a survey, particularly when many other dystonia treatments had been tried. Physicians should be aware that parents may treat their child with severe, painful dystonia with cannabis. Placebo-controlled studies of products containing cannabidiol and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol are needed for pediatric tone disorders."
18,Małgorzata Łupina,"Linagliptin is a selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor which suppresses the rapid degradation of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). In clinical practice, it is used as an antidiabetic drug, but recent studies have confirmed its role in the activity of the central nervous system (CNS). The reported study focused on the role of linagliptin (10 and 20 mg/kg, ip) in the morphine rewarding effect, analyzing how the agent had influenced the conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats via the expression, acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of the morphine rewarding effect. The obtained results clearly demonstrated linagliptin to inhibit the expression and acquisition, to accelerate the extinction and, eventually, to reduce the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP. The undertaken experiments significantly extended our knowledge on the mechanisms behind the morphine rewarding effect."

This study aimed to assess the effects of the multisensory rehabilitation product for stroke patients on cortical activation response through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).


METHODS
The music rehabilitation glove (MRG), multisensory rehabilitation product, was developed with a user-centered design concept. The 40-channel NIRS system monitored the cortical activation changes in the motor cortex (MC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), temporal lobe (TL) and occipital lobe (OL) of 22 young subjects during ""sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movements (SFTOM)"" phase of traditional training and ""musical finger-to-thumb opposition movements (MFTOM)"" phase of MRG training.


RESULTS
The two phases of training showed significant activation (P < 0.05) in the cerebral cortex compared with baseline, with more activation during MFTOM in the MC, PFC and TL. Compared with SFTOM, there were 22 channels of cortical activation in MFTOM that had significant enhancements (P < 0.05). There was also a significant positive correlation between the prefrontal cortex and motor cortex in the cortical activation.


CONCLUSIONS
According to these results, MFTOM-induced cortical activation in the MC, PFC and TL with visual, auditory and tactile stimuli was stronger than SFTOM, providing evidence that the multisensory stimulation is more beneficial to cortical activation and cognitive control to promote neurological recovery."
575,Giulia De Bonis,"Cortical slow oscillations (≲1 Hz) are an emergent property of the cortical network that integrate connectivity and physiological features. This rhythm, highly revealing of the characteristics of the underlying dynamics, is a hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and represents a default activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Wave Analysis Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way, allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects, or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical simulations. By using the SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites. Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral toward occipito-medial regions, further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results obtained using the SWAP will be essential for producing data-driven brain simulations. A spatial characterization of slow oscillations will also trigger a discussion on the role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties."
275,Nicola D Fearn,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) is one of the most common causes of arterial ischaemic stroke in a previously healthy child. Distinguishing between different subtypes of arteriopathy is challenging and has significant management implications.


RECENT FINDINGS
Recent studies have helped to define the subtypes of focal cerebral arteriopathies and improved understanding of their clinical and radiological features. In addition, they have reported new evidence for the association between viral infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of FCA and proposed new radiological, serum and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to guide diagnosis and management. There is limited evidence to guide treatment of FCA but a role for steroids and antiviral therapies have been reported.


SUMMARY
Despite the recent advances there is a limited knowledge of the pathophysiology and outcomes following FCA. Research priorities include the identification of biomarkers to improve accuracy of initial diagnosis and predict progression, and interventional trials to determine best treatments to reduce stroke recurrence risk."

716,Masumi Seki,"Central skull base osteomyelitis (CSBO) that has expanded to the middle cranial fossa is a rare complication of nasopharyngeal infection in children. Diagnosing CSBO is challenging in children, because specific symptoms are lacking and imaging findings can mimic skull base malignancy. We report on a 3-year-old girl who complained of pyrexia, headache, and vomiting and in whom a mass around the clivus was detected with magnetic resonance imaging. The patient received a diagnosis of CSBO based on characteristic imaging findings and the detection of a Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) in blood cultures. Clinical symptoms and abnormal imaging findings, including a mass lesion, were improved by prompt antibiotic treatment. The present patient had paranasal sinusitis with bacteremia of SMG, leading to the speculation of hematogeneous dissemination of SMG from the paranasal sinus. Awareness of CSBO, its early diagnosis, and aggressive management are required because CSBO is associated with high morbidity due to a life-threating infection involving multiple cranial nerves."

A major gap in the field of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is whether or not long-lasting neuroprotection can be achieved. Moreover, the specific mechanisms underlying IPC and how they can be translated into the clinic remain uncertain. To fill these gaps, we tested the hypothesis that IPC exerts long-lasting structural and functional neuroprotection against ischemic stroke through the master gatekeeper of antioxidant defenses, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). We also tested whether the brain could be pharmaceutically preconditioned with a potent and blood-brain barrier-permeable Nrf2 activator, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-oleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-trifluoethyl amide (CDDO-TFEA).


METHODS
IPC was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 12 min, and ischemic stroke was generated by MCAO for 60 min in wild-type (WT) or Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice. Sensorimotor function, learning/memory skills, and brain tissue loss were measured up to 35 days after stroke. Primary rodent cortical neurons from wildtype (WT) and Nrf2 KO mice were subjected to lethal oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or a brief OGD episode as a preconditioning (PC) stimulus before OGD. Cell viability/death, lipid electrophile generation, and Nrf2 activation were measured. CDDO-TFEA or its vehicle was administered in vivo for three consecutive days before MCAO. Tissue loss and neurological tests were performed 35 days after stroke.


RESULTS
IPC significantly reduced sensorimotor deficits, post-stroke cognitive impairments, and brain tissue loss, 35 days after MCAO in WT mice. These enduring protective effects of IPC were inhibited in Nrf2 KO mice. In neuronal cultures, PC also endowed primary neurons with ischemic tolerance against OGD-induced cell death, an effect that was abolished by loss of Nrf2 expression in KO neurons. PC induced the generation of low levels of lipid electrophiles and led to activation of the Nrf2 pathway. The mechanism underlying IPC may be translatable, as exogenous administration of the Nrf2 activator CDDO-TFEA significantly reduced neurological dysfunction and ischemic brain damage after MCAO.


CONCLUSIONS
IPC provides long-lasting neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury and post-stroke cognitive dysfunction. Nrf2 activation plays a key role in this beneficial outcome and is a promising therapeutic target for the attenuation of ischemic brain injury."
1002,Adrien E Schramm,"We developed a new rodent model of reversible brain anoxia and performed continuous electrocorticographic (ECoG) and intracellular recordings of neocortical neurons to identify in real-time the cellular and network dynamics that successively emerge throughout the dying-to-recovery process. Along with a global decrease in ECoG amplitude, deprivation of oxygen supply resulted in an early surge of beta-gamma activities, accompanied by rhythmic membrane depolarizations and regular firing in pyramidal neurons. ECoG and intracellular signals were then dominated by low-frequency activities which progressively declined towards isoelectric levels. Cortical neurons during the isoelectric state underwent a massive membrane potential depolarizing shift, captured in the ECoG as a large amplitude triphasic wave known as the ""wave-of-death"" (WoD). This neuronal anoxic depolarization, associated with a block of action potentials and a loss of cell integrative properties, could however be reversed if brain re-oxygenation was rapidly restored (within 23.5 min). The subsequent slow repolarization of neocortical neurons resulted in a second identifiable ECoG wave we termed ""wave-of-resuscitation"" since it inaugurated the progressive regaining of pre-anoxic synaptic and firing activities. These results demonstrate that the WoD is not a biomarker of an irremediable death and unveil the cellular correlates of a novel ECoG wave that may be predictive of a successful recovery. The identification of real-time biomarkers of onset and termination of cell anoxic insult could benefit research on interventional strategies to optimize resuscitation procedures."
