1,Murat Çetkin,"Hair whorl direction and handedness were stated to have a common genetic basis in the random recessive model. This study was carried out with a total of 317 healthy young males. The association between hair whorl swirling direction and handedness, footedness and eyedness were assessed. The direction of hair whorl was clockwise at a rate of 76.7%, and counter clock wise at a rate of 23.3%. There was no significant association between hair whorl direction and handedness, footedness, and eyedness (p > .05). The results indicate that hair whorl swirling direction is not an evident marker of functional laterality.",Selin Bayko;Tunç Kutoğlu
2,Lisa Marie Haraldseide,"Purpose: To explore if preoperative patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) provides additional prognostic value as a supplement to other preoperatively known clinical factors in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG).Methods: In a prospective explorative study, 114 patients with high-grade glioma were included. The participants completed the generic HRQoL questionnaire EQ-5D 3L, and the disease-specific questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20 1-3 days before surgery. Operating neurosurgeons scored the patient's preoperative functional level by using Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify HRQoL domains that were associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Log-rank tests were used to visualize differences in survival between groups.Results: In addition to preoperative KPS and age, the EORTC QLQ-BN20 subdomains 'seizures' (HR 0.98, p < .006), 'itchy skin' (HR 1.01, p < .036) and 'bladder control' (HR 1.01, p < .023) were statistically significant independent predictors of survival in a multivariate cox model.Conclusions: Our results suggest that in patients with HGG, certain preoperative symptom scales within EORTC QLQ-BN20 may provide additional prognostic information to supplement other clinical prognostic factors. However, further studies are required to validate our findings. Overall the instruments EQ-5D 3L and EORTC QLQ-C30 do not seem to provide much additional valuable prognostic information to already known prognostic factors.",Asgeir Store Jakola;Ole Solheim;Lisa Millgård Sagberg
3,Joenilton Saturnino Cazé Da Silva,"Episodic memory (EM) is a subsystem responsible for storing and evoking information about the ""What"", ""Where"" and ""When"" elements of an event in an integrated way. This capacity depends of structures with hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The effect of aging on some capacities mediated by these areas, such as the influence of the number of objects on the coding of EM, remains unexplored. The present study examined the memory recall capacity of young and older adults in an EM task which used the number of 2, 4 and 6 items associated with specific space-temporal contexts. The young adults showed better performance coefficients than the older adults in all tasks, regardless of the load used, for all questions, except the ""What"" type. The group differences increase with load augmentation, stabilizing from the tasks with 4 items. In short, the EM efficiency, evaluated through What-Where-When Task, depends on the quantity information encoding.",Flávio Freitas Barbosa;Égina Karoline Gonçalves Da Fonsêca;Fabíola Da Silva Albuquerque;Lucy G Cheke;Bernardino Fernández-Calvo
4,Kelly A Durbin,"Research suggests that mood can moderate age differences in recognizing facial emotion. In this study, we examined how an anxious versus calm mood state affected younger and older adults' processing of emotional faces. Older adults had greater difficulty identifying negative emotions, particularly when emotions were displayed at a low intensity level. However, an anxious mood did not affect age differences in emotional face recognition. In contrast, age, emotional intensity, and current mood state all affected the perceived intensity of emotion. The effects of age and mood on perceived emotional intensity were only observed for low intensity facial expressions. When induced into an anxious mood, younger adults perceived threatening emotions (i.e., fear, anger) as more emotionally intense, whereas older adults perceived anger and happiness to be more intense. These findings emphasize the need to consider both internal and external factors when investigating the effects of age on emotional face processing.",Sarah Rastegar;Bob G Knight
5,Mckenna E Williams,"Although age-related memory differences between young and older adults have been well documented, fewer studies have investigated memory changes in middle age. We examined the performance of healthy middle-aged adults (40-55 years of age; n = 32) in relation to healthy young (18-25 years of age; n = 57) and older adults (65+ years of age; n = 55) on variations of recognition discriminability (RD) indices derived from the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II). Middle-aged adults performed significantly worse (ps < .05) than young adults on multiple RD indices that incorporate semantically related distractor items, suggesting memory changes in middle age may be associated with increased susceptibility to semantic interference. Moreover, middle-aged adults performed comparably to older adults across all RD indices, indicating the recognition profile of middle-aged adults on RD indices more closely resembles that of older adults than young adults.",Lisa V Graves;Emily J Van Etten;Heather M Holden;Lisa Delano-Wood;Mark W Bondi;Jody Corey-Bloom;Dean C Delis;Paul E Gilbert
6,Tomoyo Morita,"Visual self-face and proprioceptive postural recognition predominantly activate the right inferior frontoparietal cortices in human right-handers at the population level. In the present study, prompted by the finding that left-handedness may alter lateralized cortical organization for language, sensory-motor, and cognitive functions observed in right-handers, we investigated individual variations in right-dominant use of the cortices in 50 right-handers and 50 left-handers during self-body recognition (self-face and proprioceptive) tasks. We also investigated possible between-tasks differences in this right-dominant use, and possible atypical left-right reversed lateralization (right-dominance for language and left-dominance for self-body recognition) in left-handers. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants performed a proprioceptive postural recognition task (experiencing illusory movements of the left and the right hands), a visual self-face recognition (self-other distinction) task, and a language (verb generation) task. To evaluate hemispheric dominance, we computed individual lateralization indices for the inferior frontoparietal activities in these tasks. Left-handedness altered the right-hemispheric dominance that was observed in the majority of right-handed participants in both self-body recognition tasks. In the left-handed group, during proprioceptive recognition, participants with right-lateralization, bilaterality, or left-lateralization were equally distributed, and during self-face recognition, right-lateralization was still observed, though the number of participants who demonstrated left-lateralization increased. Atypical left-right reversed lateralization was only observed in left-handed participants, but during both self-body recognition tasks. The present study provides novel and valuable knowledge about right-hemispheric dominance in self-body recognition affected by left-handedness. We discuss how functional lateralization of self-body recognition is shaped in human brain, in terms of handedness, language lateralization, and development.",Minoru Asada;Eiichi Naito
7,Chun-Hao Wang,"Motor expertise has recently been associated with differences in domain-general cognition. Studies using averaged neurophysiological signals (e.g., event-related potentials) have shown varying degree of expertise-related differences in neural activity. As a result, the precise mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be described. Here we used multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) to investigate whether the complexity of underlying neural systems working in a wide-range time scales can better explain the cognitive characteristics of athletes with different domains of expertise. Behavioral and electroencephalograms (EEG) measures of athletes practicing an interceptive sport (badminton; n = 17) or a static sport (long-distance running; n = 17) were assessed during a flanker task with varying degrees of response conflict. The interceptive sport players showed superior behavioral performance overall on the task relative to the static sport players. Although both groups exhibited greater sample entropy across most time scales in high-conflict relative to low-conflict trials over the parietal site, this effect was only evident at coarser time scales over the midfrontal site for the interceptive sport players. Together, our results suggest that individual differences in motor expertise may be associated with difference in information-processing capacity and information integration during cognitive processing, as demonstrated by differential cognitive modulation of brain signal variability.",Wei-Kuang Liang;David Moreau
8,Ricardo Piña,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent psychiatric childhood disorder, characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and impaired attention, treated most frequently with methylphenidate (MPH). For children and adults with ADHD who do not respond satisfactorily or do not tolerate well stimulants such as MPH or D-Amphetamine, for them the alternative is to use Atomoxetine (ATX), a norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor that increase extracellular NE. We examined the effects of ATX on behavior and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the murine prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) model of ADHD. ADHD symptoms were measured using behavioral tests, open field for hyperactivity and the Y-maze for spatial working memory. Further, ATX effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices at the CA3-CA1 synapse were assessed. PNE mice exhibited the behavioral deficits of ADHD, hyperactivity and spatial memory impairment. Intraperitoneal injection of ATX (2 mg/kg/day) normalized these behaviors significantly after 7 days. In PNE mice LTP was reduced (110.6 ± 4.5% %; n = 7) compared to controls (148.9 ± 5.2%; n = 7; p < 0.05). ATX administration (5 µM) reestablished the LTP in PNE mice to levels similar to the controls (157.7 ± 6.3%; n = 7). Paired-pulse ratios (PPR) were not significantly different for any condition. These results indicate that administration of ATX in a PNE model of ADHD reestablishes TBS-dependent LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses. The results suggest postsynaptic changes in synaptic plasticity as part of the mechanisms that underlie improvement of ADHD symptoms induced by ATX.",Carlos Rozas;Darwin Contreras;Paulina Hardy;Gonzalo Ugarte;Marc L Zeise;Patricio Rojas;Bernardo Morales
9,Moriya Ben Yakir-Blumkin,"Static magnetic field (SMF) is gaining interest as a potential technique for modulating CNS neuronal activity. Previous studies have shown a pro-neurogenic effect of short periods of extremely low frequency pulsatile magnetic fields (PMF) in vivo and pro-survival effect of low intensity SMF in cultured neurons in vitro, but little is known about the in vivo effects of low to moderate intensity SMF on brain functions. We investigated the effect of continuously-applied SMF on subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and immature doublecortin (DCX)-expressing cells in the neocortex of young adult rats and in primary cultures of cortical neurons in vitro. A small (3 mm diameter) magnetic disc was implanted on the skull of rats at bregma, producing an average field strength of 4.3 mT at SVZ and 12.9 mT at inner neocortex. Levels of proliferation of SVZ stem cells were determined by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labelling, and early neuronal phenotype development was determined by expression of doublecortin (DCX). To determine the effect of SMF on neurogenesis in vitro, permanent magnets were placed beneath the culture dishes. We found that low intensity SMF exposure enhances cell proliferation in SVZ and new DCX-expressing cells in neocortical regions of young adult rats. In primary cortical neuronal cultures, SMF exposure increased the expression of newly generated cells co-labelled with EdU and DCX or the mature neuronal marker NeuN, while activating a set of pro neuronal bHLH genes. SMF exposure has potential for treatment of neurodegenerative disease and conditions such as CNS trauma and affective disorders in which increased neurogenesis is desirable.",Yelena Loboda;Levi Schächter;John P M Finberg
10,George M Opie,"The effects of muscle fatigue are known to be altered in older adults, and age-related changes in the brain are likely to be a contributing factor. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are not known. The aim of the current study was to use transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to investigate age-related changes in cortical excitability with muscle fatigue. In 23 young (mean age ± SD: 22 ± 2 years) and 17 older (mean age ± SD: 68.3 ± 5.6 years) adults, single-pulse TMS-EEG was applied before, during and after the performance of fatiguing, intermittent isometric abduction of the index finger. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) measures of cortical excitability were increased during (estimated mean difference, 123.3%; P < 0.0001) and after (estimated mean difference, 117.5%; P = 0.001) fatigue and this was not different between groups (P > 0.5). For TMS-EEG, the amplitude of the P30 and P180 potentials were unaffected by fatigue in older participants (P > 0.05). In contrast, the amplitude of the N45 potential in older adults was significantly reduced both during (positive cluster: mean voltage difference = 0.7 µV, P < 0.005; negative cluster: mean voltage difference = 0.9 µV, P < 0.0005) and after (mean voltage difference = 0.5 µV, P < 0.005) fatiguing exercise, whereas this response was absent in young participants. These results suggest that performance of maximal intermittent isometric exercise in old but not young adults is associated with modulation of cortical inhibition likely mediated by activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors.",Lavender A Otieno;Maryam Pourmajidian;John G Semmler;Simranjit K Sidhu
11,C Lee,"Endolymphatic hydrops is associated with low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, with a large body of research dedicated to examining its putative causal role in low-frequency hearing loss. Investigations have been thwarted by the fact that hearing loss is measured in intact ears, but gold standard assessments of endolymphatic hydrops are made postmortem only; and that no objective low-frequency hearing measure has existed. Yet the association of endolymphatic hydrops with low-frequency hearing loss is so strong that it has been established as one of the important defining features for Ménière's disease, rendering it critical to detect endolymphatic hydrops early, regardless of whether it serves a causal role or is the result of other disease mechanisms. We surgically induced endolymphatic hydrops in guinea pigs and employed our recently developed objective neural measure of low-frequency hearing, the Auditory Nerve Overlapped Waveform (ANOW). Hearing loss and endolymphatic hydrops were assessed at various time points after surgery. The ANOW detected low-frequency hearing loss as early as the first day after surgery, well before endolymphatic hydrops was found histologically. The ANOW detected low-frequency hearing loss with perfect sensitivity and specificity in all ears after endolymphatic hydrops developed, where there was a strong linear relationship between degree of endolymphatic hydrops and severity of low-frequency hearing loss. Further, histological data demonstrated that endolymphatic hydrops is seen first in the high-frequency cochlear base, though the ANOW demonstrated that dysfunction begins in the low-frequency apical cochlear half. The results lay the groundwork for future investigations of the causal role of endolymphatic hydrops in low-frequency hearing loss.",C V Valenzuela;S S Goodman;D Kallogjeri;C A Buchman;J T Lichtenhan
12,Devry Mourra,"The role of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in regulating appetitive behavior continues to be controversial. Earlier literature suggests that reduced D2R signaling diminishes motivated behavior while more recent theories suggest that reduced D2R, as has been putatively observed in obesity, facilitates compulsive appetitive behavior and promotes overeating. Using a homecage foraging paradigm with mice, we revisit classic neuroleptic pharmacological studies from the 1970s that led to the 'extinction mimicry' hypothesis: that dopamine blockade reduces reinforcement leading to an extinction-like reduction in a learned, motivated behavior. We complement this with a selective genetic deletion of D2R in indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs). Administration of haloperidol shifts foraging strategy toward less effortful, more thrifty pursuit of food without altering consumption or bodyweight. D2R deletion in iMSNs also reduces effort and energy expended toward food pursuit, but without a compensatory shift in foraging strategy, resulting in loss of body weight, an effect more pronounced under conditions of escalating costs as the knockouts fail to adequately increase effort. The selective knockouts exhibit no change in sucrose preference or sucrose reinforcement. These data suggest that striatal D2R regulates effort in response to costs, mediating cost sensitivity and behavioral thrift. In the context of obesity, these data suggest that reduced D2R is more likely to diminish effort and behavioral energy expenditure rather than increase appetitive motivation and consumption, possibly contributing to reduced physical activity commonly observed in obesity.",Federico Gnazzo;Steve Cobos;Jeff A Beeler
13,Yuhang Gong,"GPR40 was utilized as the drug target to the treatment of diabetes, but the function and mechanisms ameliorating the Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unknown. In present study, the typical APP/PS1 mouse model was applied to explore the function and mechanism of GPR40 in AD. GPR40 agonist GW9508 and antagonist GW1100 were respectively given by i.c.v. injection to activate/inhibit the GPR40 in the brain of APP/PS1 mice which illustrated the function and mechanism of GPR40 in ameliorating AD symptoms. Morris water maze test, step-through test, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, open field test and new object recognition test were used to test the cognitive function and memory ability of mice, while molecular biology experiments such as Western blot, immunofluorescence, JC-1 were used to detect the corresponding changes of signal pathways. The results revealed that treatment with GW9508 could significantly ameliorate cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice, upregulate the expression levels of cAMP, p-CREB and neurotrophic factors in vivo, while GW9508 also ameliorate Aβ1-42-induced neuron damage and downregulate the expression levels of pathological protein such as p-JNK, JNK and apoptosis-related proteins such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and caspase-3 in vitro. Meanwhile, high-content screening also showed that GW9508 promoted the cellular differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, while GW1100 reversed the effects of GW9508. These results suggested that GPR40 was an underlying therapeutic target for the treatment of AD and GPR40 agonist could be explored as the emerging AD therapeutic drug.",Jingjing Chen;Yongzeng Jin;Chen Wang;Menglin Zheng;Ling He
14,James Dowsett,"BACKGROUND
The ability to record brain activity in humans during movement, and in real world environments, is an important step towards understanding cognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited to mobile applications but suffers from the problem of artefacts introduced into the signal during movement. Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) give an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and averaging a sufficient number of trials will eventually remove any noise not phase locked to the visual flicker.


NEW METHOD
Here we present a method for producing SSVEPs of real world environments using modified LCD shutter glasses, which are commonly used for 3D TV, by adapting the glass to flicker at neurophysiologically relevant frequencies (alpha band). Participants viewed a room whilst standing and walking. Either the left or right side of the room was illuminated, to test if it is possible to recover the resulting SSVEPs when walking, as well as to probe the effect of walking on neural activity. Additionally, by using a signal generator to produce ""simulated SSVEPs"" on the scalp we can demonstrate that this method is able to accurately recover evoked neural responses during walking.


RESULTS
The amplitude of SSVEPs over right parietal cortex was reduced by walking. Furthermore, the waveform and phase of the SSVEPs is highly preserved between walking and standing, but was sensitive to whether the left or right side of the room was illuminated.


CONCLUSIONS
This method allows probing neural responses during natural movements within real environments, potentially at a wide range of frequencies.",Marianne Dieterich;Paul C J Taylor
15,Peyman Najafi,"In recent years, studying the central mechanism of itch has gained momentum. However, a proper meta-analysis has not been conducted in this domain. In this study, we tried to respond to this need. A systematic search and a meta-analysis were carried out to estimate the central mechanism of itch. The itch matrix comprises the thalamus and the parietal, secondary somatosensory, insular and cingulate cortices. We have shown that the basal ganglia (BG) play an important role in itch reduction. Finally, we explored itch processing in AD patients and observed that the itch matrix in these patients was different. In conclusion, this is the first meta-analysis on the central mechanisms of itch perception and processing. Our study demonstrated that different modalities of itch induction can produce a common pattern of activity in the brain and provided further insights into understanding the underlying nature of itch central perception.",Jean-Luc Carré;Douraied Ben Salem;Emilie Brenaut;Laurent Misery;Olivier Dufor
16,Rafael Guimarães Dos Santos,"Serotoninergic hallucinogens include drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and psilocybin. Recent trials with single/few doses of these compounds show that they induce rapid and sustained antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects. These effects are also observed in religious groups using the DMT-containing brew ayahuasca. The agonist action of these substances on 5-HT2A receptors expressed in frontal and limbic areas increase glutamatergic transmission and neuroplasticity. These neurochemical effects are associated with acute alterations on self-perception and increases in introspection and positive mood, and with subacute and long-term decreases in psychiatric symptoms, increases in some personality traits such as openness, improvements in emotional processing, and increases in empathy. These are preliminary but promising results that should be further explored in controlled trials with larger sample sizes, especially considering that these compounds could be beneficial in the treatment of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders.",Jaime Eduardo Cecilio Hallak
17,Nelly Alia-Klein,"This review of the neuroscience of anger is part of The Human Affectome Project, where we attempt to map anger and its components (i.e., physiological, cognitive, experiential) to the neuroscience literature (i.e., genetic markers, functional imaging of human brain networks) and to linguistic expressions used to describe anger feelings. Given the ubiquity of anger in both its normative and chronic states, specific language is used in humans to express states of anger. Following a review of the neuroscience literature, we explore the language that is used to convey angry feelings, as well as metaphors reflecting inner states of anger experience. We then discuss whether these linguistic expressions can be mapped on to the neural circuits during anger experience and to distinct components of anger. We also identify relationships between anger components, brain networks, and other affective research relevant to motivational states of dominance and basic needs for safety.",Gabriela Gan;Gadi Gilam;Jessica Bezek;Antonio Bruno;Thomas F Denson;Talma Hendler;Leroy Lowe;Veronica Mariotti;Maria R Muscatello;Sara Palumbo;Silvia Pellegrini;Pietro Pietrini;Amelia Rizzo;Edelyn Verona
18,Małgorzata Łupina,"Linagliptin is a selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor which suppresses the rapid degradation of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). In clinical practice, it is used as an antidiabetic drug, but recent studies have confirmed its role in the activity of the central nervous system (CNS). The reported study focused on the role of linagliptin (10 and 20 mg/kg, ip) in the morphine rewarding effect, analyzing how the agent had influenced the conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats via the expression, acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of the morphine rewarding effect. The obtained results clearly demonstrated linagliptin to inhibit the expression and acquisition, to accelerate the extinction and, eventually, to reduce the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP. The undertaken experiments significantly extended our knowledge on the mechanisms behind the morphine rewarding effect.",Sylwia Talarek;Jolanta Kotlińska;Ewa Gibuła-Tarłowska;Piotr Listos;Joanna Listos
19,Sandra Dörrenbächer,"Cognitive control is supported by a dynamic interplay of transient brain activation across fronto-parietal networks and sustained activation across fronto-striatal networks. Older adults show disturbances in this dynamic functional recruitment. There is evidence suggesting that cognitive-control training may enable older adults to redistribute their brain activation across cortical and subcortical networks, which in turn can limit behavioral impairments. However, previous studies have only focused on spatial rather than on temporal aspects of changes in brain activation. In the present study, we examined training-related functional plasticity in old age by applying a hybrid fMRI design that sensitively tracks the spatio-temporal interactions underlying brain-activation changes. Fifty healthy seniors were assigned to a task-shifting training or an active-control group and their pretest/posttest activation-change maps were compared against 25 untrained younger adults. After training, older adults showed the same performance as untrained young adults. Compared to the control group, task-shifting training promoted proactive changes in transient mechanisms supporting the maintenance and biasing of task-set representations in a specific prefrontal circuitry; reactive changes in transient mechanisms supporting response-selection processes in dissociable fronto-parietal networks; overall reductions of sustained activation in striatal circuits. Results highlight the importance of spatio-temporal interactions in training-induced neural changes in age.",Carolyn Wu;Hubert Zimmer;Jutta Kray
20,Brecht Polspoel,"Only a small amount of studies have looked at the structural neural correlates of children's arithmetic. Furthermore, these studies mainly implemented voxel-based morphometry, which only takes the volume of regions into account, without looking at other structural properties. The current study aimed to contribute knowledge on which brain regions are important for children's arithmetic on a structural level, by not only implementing voxel-based morphometry, but also cortical complexity analyses, based on the fractal dimension index. This complexity measure describes a characteristic of surface shape. Data of 43 typically developing 9-10 year-olds were analyzed. All children were asked to take part in two test sessions: behavioral data collection and MRI data acquisition. For data analysis, mean values for volume and cortical complexity were estimated within regions of interest (ROIs) and extracted for further analysis. The selected ROIs were based on regions found to be related to children's mathematical abilities in previous research. Results point towards associations between arithmetic fluency and the volume of the right fusiform gyrus, as well as the cortical complexity of the left postcentral gyrus, right insular sulcus, and left lateral orbital sulcus. Remarkably, no significant associations were observed between the children's arithmetic fluency and the volume or cortical complexity of typically arithmetic-associated parietal regions, such as the superior parietal lobe, intraparietal sulcus, or angular gyrus. Accordingly, the current study highlights the importance of structural characteristics of brain regions other than these typically arithmetic-associated parietal regions for children's arithmetic fluency.",Maaike Vandermosten;Bert De Smedt
21,Benedito Jamilson Araújo Pereira,"PURPOSE
To evaluate the relationship between meningioma histological subtype and tumor site in under-20 year-olds.


METHODS
A review of the literature on meningioma during the first 2 decades of life was carried out through a Medline search up to February 2019. To evaluate the adult population, a cross-sectional study was conducted on patients operated on between 2000 and 2014 in a single institution. Exclusion criteria comprised: series reports and papers that lacked detailed description of clinical findings, neuroimaging confirmation of tumor location, and/or at least 5 years' follow-up.


RESULTS
107 manuscripts were included, for 365 under-20 year-old patients: 200 male, and 164 female. Histopathology found 197 cases (53.9%) of WHO grade I meningioma, with predominance of meningothelial (41.1%) and transitional (30.9%) subtypes; 123 (33.7%) grade II, and 45 (12.3%) grade III. For 65 (18.25%) of the 356 cases, recurrence was documented, with only 24 deaths (6.7%).


CONCLUSION
Meningioma in this population presented 2 differences compared to the adult population: male predominance, and high incidence of atypical meningioma. Surgery was the primary treatment.

22,Zhichun Chen,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a 200 year-long research history. Our understanding about its clinical phenotype and pathogenesis remains limited, although dopaminergic replacement therapy has significantly improved patient outcomes. Autonomic dysfunction is an essential category of non-motor phenotypes that has recently become a cutting edge field that directs frontier research in PD. In this review, we initially describe the epidemiology of dysautonomic symptoms in PD. Then, we perform a meticulous analysis of the pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunction in PD and propose that the peripheral autonomic nervous system may be a key route for α-synuclein pathology propagation from the periphery to the central nervous system. In addition, we recommend that constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and pure autonomic failure should be viewed as prodromal dysautonomic markers in PD prediction and diagnosis. Finally, we summarize the strategies currently available for the treatment of autonomic dysfunction in PD and suggest that high-quality, better-designed, randomized clinical trials should be conducted in the future.",Guanglu Li;Jun Liu
23,Nanae Fukushima,"Crush injury to peripheral nerves in adult animals is considered not to trigger retrograde neuronal cell death; however, several studies reported neuronal cell death following severe injuries including nerve transection, resection, or avulsion. However, the rate of neuronal cell death varied among studies. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of very severe nerve injury by long nerve resection in adult rats. Right hypoglossal (XII) nerve was exposed, and a 9-mm section was resected. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the resection, the number of XII neurons were counted in from the rostral to caudal sections. The number of XII neurons in the injured right side was reduced after the XII nerve resection compared with the uninjured left side. The mean rates of surviving neurons at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the nerve resection were 83.5 %, 73.9 %, and 61.1 %, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of the control. The number of XII neurons after extensive XII nerve resection declined gradually over a relatively long time period, revealing that extensive nerve resection led to slow cell death of the injured neurons.",Tatsuya Kobayashi;Akira Kakegawa;Norimi Sumitomo;Ayata Nagira;Tetsuji Moriizumi
24,Yan-Hai Li,"Medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons are involved in the regulation of eye movements to endure the stability of the image during head movement, and play a critical role in plasticity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during the juvenile period. We have previously shown that the long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission was induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) and blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-APV at the vestibular afferent synapses of type-B MVN neurons. In the present study, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro to investigate the subunit composition of these NMDA receptors in the induction of LTD in MVN slices from postnatal 13-16 day rats. We found that LTD induced in type-B neurons of the rat MVN with HFS was blocked by Ro 25-6981, a specific antagonist for GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. Moreover, the other selective GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor antagonist (ifenprodil) also prevented the induction of LTD. However, bath application of the GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor antagonists (Zn2+ and TCN 201) had no influence on the induction of LTD. Similar results were obtained by exogenously applied two GluN2C/GluN2D-preferring NMDA receptor antagonists (PPDA and UBP 141). Furthermore, presynaptic NMDA receptor subunits are not necessary for vestibular LTD. These results suggest that the induction of LTD by HFS in vestibular afferent synapses of type-B MVN neurons requires postsynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, but not GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors or GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors.",Youjun Li;Liang Zheng;Jue Wang
25,Rafael Pazinatto Aguiar,"Pharmacological interventions that selectively activate serotonin 5-hydroxytryptramine-1A (5-HT1A) heteroreceptors may prevent or attenuate the consequences of brain ischemic episodes. The present study investigated whether the preferential 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptor agonist NLX-101 (a.k.a. F15599) mitigates cognitive and emotional impairments and affects neuroplasticity in mice that are subjected to the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model of brain ischemia. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram (Esc) was used for comparative purposes because it is able to decrease morbidity and improve recovery in stroke patients and ischemic rodents. Sham and BCCAO mice received daily doses of NLX-101 (0.32 mg/kg, i.p) or Esc (20 mg/kg, i.p) for 28 days. During this period, they were evaluated for locomotor activity, anxiety- and despair-related behaviors and hippocampus-dependent cognitive function, using the open field, elevated zero maze, forced swim test and object location test, respectivelly. The mice's brains were processed for biochemical and histological analyses. BCCAO mice exhibited high anxiety and despair-like behaviors and performed worse than controls in the cognitive assessment. BCCAO induced neuronal and dendritic spine loss and decreases in the protein levels of neuronal plasticity markers, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptophysin (SYN), and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. NLX-101 and Esc attenuated cognitive impairments and despair-like behaviors in BCCAO mice. Only Esc decreased anxiety-like behaviors due to brain ischemia. Both NLX-101 and Esc blocked the increase in plasma corticosterone levels and, restored BDNF, SYN and PSD-95 protein levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, both compounds impacted positively dentritic remodeling in the hippocampus and PFC of ischemic mice. In the PFC, NLX-101 increased the BDNF protein levels, while Esc in turn, attenuated the decrease in the PSD-95 protein levels induced by BCCAO. The present results suggest that activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors is the molecular mechanism for serotonergic protective effects in BCCAO. Moreover, post-synaptic biased agonists such as NLX-101 might constitute promising therapeutics for treatment of functional and neurodegenerative outcomes of brain ischemia.",Lígia Mendes Soares;Erika Meyer;Fernanda Canova da Silveira;Humberto Milani;Adrian Newman-Tancredi;Mark Varney;Jos Prickaerts;Rúbia M Weffort de Oliveira
26,Manon Meyrel,"Increasing evidence suggest a bidirectional link between disrupted circadian rhythms and alcohol use disorders (AUD). A better understanding of these alcohol-induced changes in circadian rhythms will likely provide important therapeutic solutions. We conducted a systematic review based on the PubMed database examining biological rhythms in all stages of alcohol use: acute alcohol consumption, AUD, alcohol withdrawal, and abstinence. Different changes in circadian rhythms have been observed after a single acute alcohol intake, but also during AUD and alcohol withdrawal. Following a single acute alcohol intake, changes in biological rhythms are dose-dependent, reflected in the melatonin and cortisol secretions, and the core body temperature (CBT) rhythms. These alterations normalize the next morning and appear mostly for acute alcohol intake higher than 0.5 g/kg. These alterations are more severe during AUD and persist over time. In addition, interestingly, opposite patterns of the melatonin physiological ratio between diurnal and nocturnal secretion (N/D ratio < 1) have been observed during AUD and appear to be a marker of chronic daily use. During alcohol withdrawal, circadian rhythms desynchronization correlates with the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and withdrawal complications such as delirium tremens. During abstinence a resynchronization of circadian rhythms of cortisol and CBT appears in most patients about 1 month after alcohol withdrawal. Disruption of melatonin circadian rhythms can persist after 3-12 weeks of abstinence. The circadian genetic vulnerability associated with biological rhythms alterations in alcohol use disorders increases the risk of relapses. Circadian-based interventions could play a critical role in preventing and treating AUD.",Benjamin Rolland;Pierre A Geoffroy
27,Norbert Kopco,"Auditory distance perception and its neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood, mainly because 1) it is difficult to separate distance processing from intensity processing, 2) multiple intensity-independent distance cues are often available, and 3) the cues are combined in a context-dependent way. A recent fMRI study identified human auditory cortical area representing intensity-independent distance for sources presented along the interaural axis (Kopco et al. PNAS, 109, 11019-11024). For these sources, two intensity-independent cues are available, interaural level difference (ILD) and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR). Thus, the observed activations may have been contributed by not only distance-related, but also direction-encoding neuron populations sensitive to ILD. Here, the paradigm from the previous study was used to examine DRR-based distance representation for sounds originating in front of the listener, where ILD is not available. In a virtual environment, we performed behavioral and fMRI experiments, combined with computational analyses to identify the neural representation of distance based on DRR. The stimuli varied in distance (15-100 cm) while their received intensity was varied randomly and independently of distance. Behavioral performance showed that intensity-independent distance discrimination is accurate for frontal stimuli, even though it is worse than for lateral stimuli. fMRI activations for sounds varying in frontal distance, as compared to varying only in intensity, increased bilaterally in the posterior banks of Heschl's gyri, the planum temporale, and posterior superior temporal gyrus regions. Taken together, these results suggest that posterior human auditory cortex areas contain neuron populations that are sensitive to distance independent of intensity and of binaural cues relevant for directional hearing.",Keerthi Kumar Doreswamy;Samantha Huang;Stephanie Rossi;Jyrki Ahveninen
28,Christina Hofmann-Shen,"Various studies have suggested that auditory deviance detection is organized in a hierarchical manner with ascending levels of complexity. Event-related potentials (ERP) are considered to reflect different cortical processing stages. In the current electroencephalographic study, we employed an auditory sequence oddball paradigm to investigate different levels of cortical auditory processing and the contribution of neuronal habituation and prediction error mechanism to N1 and Mismatch Negativity (MMN). Our findings suggest that N1 reflects a lower cortical process primarily involved in the encoding of simple physical features and is thus mainly modulated by neuronal attenuation and not complex top-down mechanisms. By analyzing within-sequence signal differences, we divided the MMN into distinct subcomponents reflecting different hierachical levels of auditory processing. We determined a ""first-order"" MMN that reflects the processing of simple deviant features (such as frequency) and ""higher-order"" MMNs that occur at regularity violation of complex patterns or unexpected inputs that do not allow further predictions. In our source localization analysis, both the primary auditory cortex and left IFG were primarily involved in the detection of simple, physically deviant features, while the right IFG was associated with the processing of novel, unexpected auditory inputs and the ACC with regularity violation of known patterns. Summarizing, our results might contribute to a better understanding of the different complexities of neuronal habituation and prediction error mechanisms at different levels of cortical auditory processing.",Bob O Vogel;Maximillian Kaffes;Armin Rudolph;Elliot C Brown;Cumhur Tas;Martin Brüne;Andres H Neuhaus
29,Walker S Pedersen,"The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are hypothesized to be the output nodes of the extended amygdala threat response, integrating multiple signals to coordinate the threat response via outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The BNST and CeA are structurally and functionally connected, suggesting interactions between these regions may regulate how the response to provocation unfolds. However, the relationship between human BNST-CeA connectivity and the behavioral response to affective stimuli is little understood. To investigate whether individual differences in BNST-CeA connectivity are related to the affective response to negatively valenced stimuli, we tested relations between resting-state BNST-CeA connectivity and both facial electromyographic (EMG) activity of the corrugator supercilii muscle and eyeblink startle magnitude during affective image presentation within the Refresher sample of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. We found that higher right BNST-CeA connectivity was associated with greater corrugator activity to negative, but not positive, images. There was a trend-level association between right BNST-CeA connectivity and trait negative affect. Eyeblink startle magnitude was not significantly related to BNST-CeA connectivity. These results suggest that functional interactions between BNST and CeA contribute to the behavioral response to negative emotional events.",Stacey M Schaefer;Lauren K Gresham;Seungbeum D Lee;Michael P Kelly;Jeanette A Mumford;Jonathan A Oler;Richard J Davidson

Our purpose was to examine how stress affects functional connectivity (FC) in language processing regions of the brain during a verbal problem solving task associated with creativity. We additionally explored how gender and the presence of the stress-susceptible short allele of the serotonin transporter gene polymorphism influenced this effect.


METHODS
Forty-five healthy participants (Mean age: 19.6 ​± ​1.6 years; 28 females) were recruited to be a part of this study and genotyped to determine the presence or absence of at least one copy of the short (S) allele of the serotonin transporter gene, which is associated with greater susceptibility to stress. The participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging in two separate sessions (stress and no stress control). One session utilized a modified version of the Montreal Imaging Stress Test (MIST) to induce stress while the other session consisted of a no stress control task. The MIST and control tasks were interleaved with task blocks during which the participants performed the compound remote associates task, a convergent task that engages divergent thinking, which is a critical component of creativity. We examined the relationship between stress effects on performance and effects on connectivity of language processing regions activated during this task.


RESULTS
There was no main effect of stress on functional connectivity for individual ROI pairs. However, in the examination of whether stress effects on performance related to effects on connectivity, changes in middle temporal gyrus connectivity with stress correlated positively with changes in solution latency for individuals with the S allele, but anti-correlated for those with only the L allele. A trend towards a gene ​× ​stress interaction on solution latency was also observed.


DISCUSSION
Results from the study suggest that genetic susceptibility to stress, such as the presence of the S allele, affects neural correlates of performance on tasks related to verbal problem solving, as indicated by connectivity of the middle temporal gyrus. Future work will need to determine whether connectivity of the middle temporal gyrus serves as a marker for the effect of stress susceptibility on cognition, extending into stress susceptible patient populations.",John P Hegarty;Bradley J Ferguson;Patrick M Hecht;Michael Tilley;Shawn E Christ;David Q Beversdorf
31,Taro Yanagawa,"OBJECTIVE
Opening of mastoid air cells (MACs), a complication of lateral suboccipital craniotomy for microvascular decompression (MVD), might cause cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and meningitis. Only a few studies have investigated the association of degree of MAC development and actual opening of MACs. The present study focused on preoperative risk assessment for predicting the opening of MACs.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study included 204 consecutive patients who underwent MVD at our hospital between January 2014 and December 2018. We retrospectively collected clinical and neuroimaging data from electronic medical charts and discharge summaries. MACs were classified into four types according to neuroimaging data. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) was used to assess patients with and without CSF leakage into MACs.


RESULTS
No CSF leakage was observed into types 1 and 2 MACs, but it was noted in 14 of 46 patients (30 %) with type 3 and 44 of 58 patients (76 %) with type 4 MACs. Opening of MACs during surgery could not be recognized in 33 (57 %). CSF rhinorrhea was noted in 1 of the 58 patients with CSF leakage into MACs and meningitis was not noted.


CONCLUSION
Patients with types 3 and 4 MACs have a high risk of CSF leakage. Complete prevention of mild symptoms, such as ear obstruction, is challenging even if opened MACs are sealed, but serious complications, such as CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis, can be avoided. For cases in which preoperative CT reveals a high risk of opening of MACs, preventive closure should be performed.",Toru Hatayama;Yoichi Harada;Eishi Sato;Keiichi Yamashita;Masaki Tanaka;Masataka Torii;Masaru Kiyomoto;Hiroya Imai;Takuro Ehara;Takuji Kono
32,Ruiqi Chen,"OBJECTIVE
Seizures are common complications following intracranial aneurysms and present a greater risk to pediatric patients than adults. Though the risk factors of seizures in adults with intracranial aneurysms have been well documented, the risk factors in pediatric patients remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for preoperative seizures and the effect of the treatment approach on postoperative seizures in pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
The data of 64 pediatric patients (mean age 11.4 ± 5.7 years; 68.8 % of males) with intracranial aneurysms were retrospectively analyzed from January 2012 to April 2017. Comparisons were made between patients with preoperative seizures (case group) and those without (control group).


RESULTS
Twenty-four patients (37.5 %) had preoperative seizures, and 15 patients (23.4 %) had postoperative seizures. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age (0-5 years), head trauma history, ruptured aneurysms, lobe hematomas, modified Fisher grade 3-4, giant aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and distal arterial aneurysms were independently associated with the increased risk of preoperative seizures. Patients in the surgical and endovascular groups did not differ significantly in the rates of preoperative seizures or early postoperative seizures (within 1 month) (P > 0.05). However, a significantly lower incidence of late postoperative seizures (1-3 months and 3-6 months) was observed in the surgical group compared with the endovascular group (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Pediatric patients with intracranial aneurysms are at high risk for seizures. Risk factors for preoperative seizures included younger age (0-5 years), head trauma history, lobe hematomas, modified Fisher grade 3-4, giant aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and distal arterial aneurysms. Compared with the endovascular treatment, surgical intervention provided more benefits with regard to reducing the risk of late postoperative seizures.",Xin Zan;Anqi Xiao;Rui Guo;Lu Xing;Lu Ma;Chao You;Yi Liu
33,Ping-Yeh Chiu,"BACKGROUND
Various surgical techniques for treating spondylodiskitis have been proposed, but the most appropriate surgical treatment remains controversial. In this study, we propose a new hybrid approach combining the use of cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws and pedicle screws with the technique of transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement and fusion (TLIDF). With this method, we can shorten the length of the segment that needs to be fixed, minimize the extent of surgical dissection, and reduce the risk of adjacent level degeneration.


METHODS
Patients with clinical and radiographic evidences of single-level lumbar spondylodiskitis seen between January and December of 2017 were included in the study. Demographic data, including age and gender, were recorded. The intra-operative details, results of culture, functional outcome, radiologic outcome, and length of hospital stay were recorded.


RESULTS
The mean age of 15 patients was 62.8 years old. The mean operative time was 135 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 260 ml. The culture rate was 80%. The mean Numeric Rating Scale score and Oswestry Disability Index score significantly improved from 6.60 to 2.47 and from 21.20 to 10.20, respectively. No major perioperative complications occurred.


CONCLUSIONS
With the proposed hybrid approach using CBT and pedicle screws with the TLIDF technique, the damaged anterior column can be debrided and reconstructed, and spinal stabilization can also be achieved.",Jia-En Chi;Fu-Cheng Kao;Ming-Kei Hsieh;Tsung-Ting Tsai
34,Telvinderjit Singh,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT
Information on the 3D shape of vertebral endplates is lacking. Prior studies have analysed 2D shape, however 3D data is important as it may help improve our understanding of how differences in shape are related to age, gender, race, size and other parameters which may subsequently help improve device design for interbody prosthesis.


PURPOSE
To study the 3D shape of lumbar vertebral endplates from normal adult lumbar spines and correlate them with age, gender, spinal/endplate level, endplate surface area, concave depth, and size.


STUDY DESIGN
In-vivo analysis of lumbar vertebral endplate 3D shape.


MATERIALS & METHODS
136 patients' CT scans were used to create 3D models of the lumbar spine for each patient which were subsequently analysed.


RESULTS
The shape of the superior endplates are different when compared to inferior endplates. Across the lumbar spine (L1-S1) the shape of inferior endplates are very similar to one another, however the shape of the superior endplate varies between spinal levels significantly. There was no clear relationship between age and Principal Component (PC) shapes but there was a strong correlation between endplate concave depth and endplate PC shape scores.


CONCLUSION
Future interbody (disc replacement and fusion) device designs could utilise the findings that inferior endplate shape is similar throughout the length of the lumbar spine, whereas superior endplate shape changes. Further, future implants could be level-specific as the present study shows that the endplate shape varies through the length of the lumbar spine.",William Parr;Wen Jie Choy;Gideon Richard Budiono;Monish Maharaj;Xavier Mathis;Kevin Phan;William Robert Walsh;Ralph Jasper Mobbs

36,Anthony M Tonsbeek,"OBJECTIVE
Aberrant vertebral artery loops are a rare clinical condition, with sparse data regarding the optimal treatment guidelines for individual patients. The heterogeneity of treatment options in the current literature creates a problem when tailoring treatments to individual patients. In this review of the literature, multiple surgical treatments for cervical vertebral artery loops were analysed and compared. In addition, this article provides a clinical case of a patient with a vertebral artery loop.


METHODS
A literature review was conducted to identify studies investigating surgical treatments for a vertebral artery loop. Different surgical techniques were examined and the involved techniques and approaches described. The outcomes were assessed for each study and the effectiveness of the treatment determined.


RESULTS
Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Six types of surgical interventions were found in the literature. Each intervention had similar postoperative results, leading to either a significant improvement or a complete resolution of symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Multiple successful surgical interventions have been described in the medical literature. However, due to the lack of evidence-based studies, no surgical intervention protocol could be determined. Treatment should therefore be tailored to individual patient's characteristics. Since not every radiologically detected VA loop is the main culprit for a patient's complaints, a thorough multidisciplinary approach is justified and advocated in patients with an atypical presentation, before a neurosurgical intervention takes place. More deliberate clinical decisions can be made once the understanding of the pathogenesis of this rare disease entity has been established and treatment protocols formulated.",Justus L Groen;Carmen L A M Vleggeert-Lankamp

41,Sho Kojima,"We evaluated the effects of moderate-intensity exercise in improving the decline in cognitive performance induced by a 24-h period of acute sleep deprivation (SD). We hypothesized that the positive effect of exercise is mediated by increased oxygenation (measured using near-infrared spectroscopy) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive performance was measured using the reaction time and interference scores of the Stroop colour and word test, in 12 healthy adults (eight males, 21.1 ± 0.3 years-old), at pre- and post-exercise. Cognitive scores were compared under two conditions: rested wakefulness (RW) and 24-h SD. The exercise consisted of 20-min of ergometer cycling at an intensity of 60 % VO2peak. Oxygenation to the DLPFC increased, at 12 min after exercise onset, compared to the baseline and was maintained until the end of the exercise in both RW and SD conditions (P < 0.01). The change in RT correlated with sleepiness (P < 0.05), with no correlation for the interference score and oxygenation. Taken together, moderate-intensity exercise reverses SD-induced cognitive decline.",Tomoya Abe;Shinichiro Morishita;Yuta Inagaki;Weixiang Qin;Kazuki Hotta;Atsuhiro Tsubaki

To assay EEG signal quality recorded with tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs) compared to regular EEG electrodes.


METHODS
EEG segments were recorded simultaneously by TCREs and regular electrodes, low-pass filtered at 35 Hz (REG35) and 70 Hz (REG70). Clips were rated blindly by nine electroencephalographers for presence or absence of key EEG features, relative to the ""gold-standard"" of the clinical report.


RESULTS
TCRE showed less EMG artifact (F = 15.4, p < 0.0001). Overall quality rankings were not significantly different. Focal slowing was better detected by TCRE and spikes were better detected by regular electrodes. Seizures (n = 85) were detected by TCRE in 64 cases (75.3%), by REG70 in 75 (88.2%) and REG35 in 69 (81.2%) electrodes. TCRE detected 9 (10.6%) seizures not detected by one of the other 2 methods. In contrast, 14 seizures (16.5%) were not detected by TCRE, but were by REG35 electrodes. Each electrode detected interictal spikes when the other did not.


CONCLUSIONS
TCRE produced similar overall quality and confidence ratings versus regular electrodes, but less muscle artifact. TCRE recordings detected seizures in 7% of instances where regular electrodes did not.

43,Adomas Bunevicius,"MR elastography allows non-invasive quantification of the shear modulus of tissue, i.e. tissue stiffness and viscosity, information that offers the potential to guide presurgical planning for brain tumor resection. Here, we review brain tumor MRE studies with particular attention to clinical applications. Studies that investigated MRE in patients with intracranial tumors, both malignant and benign as well as primary and metastatic, were queried from the Pubmed/Medline database in August 2018. Reported tumor and normal appearing white matter stiffness values were extracted and compared as a function of tumor histopathological diagnosis and MRE vibration frequencies. Because different studies used different elastography hardware, pulse sequences, reconstruction inversion algorithms, and different symmetry assumptions about the mechanical properties of tissue, effort was directed to ensure that similar quantities were used when making inter-study comparisons. In addition, because different methodologies and processing pipelines will necessarily bias the results, when pooling data from different studies, whenever possible, tumor values were compared with the same subject's contralateral normal appearing white matter to minimize any study-dependent bias. The literature search yielded 10 studies with a total of 184 primary and metastatic brain tumor patients. The group mean tumor stiffness, as measured with MRE, correlated with intra-operatively assessed stiffness of meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Pooled data analysis showed significant overlap between shear modulus values across brain tumor types. When adjusting for the same patient normal appearing white matter shear modulus values, meningiomas were the stiffest tumor-type. MRE is increasingly being examined for potential in brain tumor imaging and might have value for surgical planning. However, significant overlap of shear modulus values between a number of different tumor types limits applicability of MRE for diagnostic purposes. Thus, further rigorous studies are needed to determine specific clinical applications of MRE for surgical planning, disease monitoring and molecular stratification of brain tumors.",Katharina Schregel;Ralph Sinkus;Alexandra Golby;Samuel Patz

45,Ouyang Chen,"Inflammation is the body's protective reaction to injury and infection. Pain is a hallmark of inflammation and can be either protective or detrimental during acute or chronic phase. Macrophages play a chief role in the pathogenesis of pain and have bilateral communications with nociceptors, the specialized primary sensory neurons that sense pain. Macrophages 'talk to' nociceptors by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) that induce pain via direct activation of nociceptors. Macrophages also 'listen to' nociceptors, by which nociceptors secrete neuropeptides and chemokines which act on macrophages. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in nociceptors releases CCL2, activating macrophages and potentiating pathological pain. Emerging evidence also points to a pro-resolution role of macrophages in inflammation and pain. Macrophage GPR37 is activated by neuroprotectin D1, a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) and resolves inflammatory pain via phagocytosis and production of IL-10 that inhibits nociceptors. Macrophage-nociceptor interactions are also mediated by microRNAs and microRNA-containing exosomes in chronic pain. Notably, extracellular microRNAs (e.g. let-7b and miR-711) can directly bind and activate nociceptors. Targeting macrophage-nociceptor interactions will help to control inflammation and pain.",Christopher R Donnelly;Ru-Rong Ji

In contrast to most vertebrates, insects usually must cope with low resolution retinal images and the inability to infer spatial features using accommodation or stereovision.

Second, I suggest that a basic understanding of number, what numerical quantity means, is innately wired into the brain and gives rise to an intuitive number sense, or number instinct. Third and finally, I argue that symbolic counting and arithmetic in humans is rooted in an evolutionarily and ontogenetically primeval neural system for non-symbolic number representations.

51,Chihiro Akiba,"INTRODUCTION
Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoid space Hydrocephalus (DESH) is considered as an important imaging feature of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).


METHOD
Subjects aged 60 and over in a memory clinic and a community-based cohort were assessed for the presence of ventriculomegaly, Sylvian dilatation, and high convexity tightness by neuroimaging, and a clinical triad of iNPH symptoms, i.e. cognitive, gait and urinary symptoms.


RESULTS
In the memory clinic-based study (548 subjects), the prevalence of DESH was 1.1% and increased with age. The clinical triad was significantly more frequent in subjects with DESH (50%) compared to those with normal images (none), Sylvian dilatation (7%), and ventriculomegaly (12%). Gait disturbance was also significantly more frequent in DESH (83%) compared to those with normal images (2%), Sylvian dilatation (14%), and ventriculomegaly (26%). In the community-based cohort (946 subjects), the prevalence of DESH was 1.0% and increased with age. The clinical triad (11%) was significantly more common in subjects with DESH compared to those with normal images (none), Sylvian dilatation (2%), and ventriculomegaly (7%). Gait disturbance was also significantly more common in DESH (33%) compared to those with normal images (1%), Sylvian dilatation (4%), and ventriculomegaly (10%).

The reported prevalence of DESH was approximately 1%, and increased with age. DESH and high convexity tightness were specifically associated with the clinical triad of iNPH.

52,David Smailes,"Introduction: It has been proposed that hallucinations occur because of problems with reality discrimination (when internal, self-generated cognitions are misattributed to an external, non-self source) and because of elevated levels of top-down processing. In this study, we examined whether visual reality discrimination abilities and elevated top-down processing (assessed via face pareidolia-proneness) were associated with how often non-clinical participants report visual hallucination-like experiences.Methods: Participants (N = 82, mean age = 23.12 years) completed a visual reality discrimination task and a face pareidolia task, as well as self-report measures of schizotypy and of the frequency of visual hallucination-like experiences.Results: Regression analysis demonstrated that the number of false alarms made on the visual reality discrimination task and the number of hits made on the face pareidolia task were independent predictors of the frequency of visual hallucination-like experiences. Correlations between performance on the tasks and levels of schizotypy were not statistically significant.Conclusions: These findings suggest that weaker visual reality discrimination abilities and elevated levels of top-down processing are associated with visual hallucination-proneness and are discussed in terms of the idea that clinical visual hallucinations and non-clinical visual hallucination-like experiences share similar cognitive mechanisms.",Emma Burdis;Constantina Gregoriou;Bryony Fenton;Rob Dudley
53,Mary H Burleson,"John Cacioppo and colleagues' Somatovisceral Afference Model of Emotion (SAME) highlighted the importance of interoception in emotional experience. Here we compare how the SAME and the more recent Theory of Constructed Emotion (TCE) view the role of interoceptive signals in creating emotional experiences. We describe the characteristics of touch sensations that are carried by thin, unmyelinated fibers called C-tactile afferents (CTs) to the posterior insula, and are thus deemed interoceptive despite their typically social (external) origin. We explore how this social interoceptive input might contribute to the emotion-related effects of social touch more generally, and speculate that all social touch, with or without CT afferent stimulation, can directly influence allostasis, or the predictive regulation of short- and long-term energy resources required by the body. Finally, we describe several features of CT-optimal touch that make it a potentially useful tool to help illuminate basic interoceptive mechanisms, emotion-related phenomena, and disorders involving atypical affect or somatosensation. These proposed ideas demonstrate the long intellectual reach of John Cacioppo and Gary Berntson's highly productive scientific collaboration, which was formative for the fields of social neuroscience, social psychophysiology, and affective neuroscience.",Karen S Quigley

Endovascular treatment (EVT) is now considered the gold standard for select patient populations with anterior circulation stroke; however, data on the treatment of posterior circulation stroke are less clear. This study aims to determine the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EVT for patients with acute BAO in a high-volume stroke center.


METHODS
This study included 187 consecutive patients with acute BAO who underwent EVT from January 2012 to July 2018 in the Beijing Tiantan Hospital. The baseline characteristics, procedure parameters, and functional outcome were assessed.


RESULTS
Among the 187 patients, 138 (73.8%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever, 33 (17.6%) underwent direct intracranial angioplasty (balloon dilation and/or stent implantation) for underlying severe intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and 91 (48.7%) underwent combined mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty. Successful recanalization [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 2b-3] was achieved in 158 patients (84.5%). Overall, the rates of functional independence [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2] and favorable outcome (mRS 0-3) at 90 days were 36.4 and 49.2%, respectively, and 90-day all-cause mortality was 20.3%.

EVT was effective and safe for treating patients with acute BAO.",Xu Tong;Feng Gao;Huiting Lao;Zhongrong Miao
55,Sebastian Proschinger,"BACKGROUND
The relevance of regular moderate to intense exercise for ameliorating psychomotor symptoms in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is becoming increasingly evident. Over the last two decades, emerging evidence from clinical studies and animal models indicate immune regulatory mechanisms in both periphery and the central nervous system that may underlie these beneficial effects. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier as the main structural interface between periphery and brain seems to play an important role in MS. Reducing the secretion of proteolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), i.e. MMP-2, as disruptors of blood-brain barrier integrity could have profound implications for MS.


METHODS
In this two-armed randomized controlled trial 64 participants with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (EDSS 0-4.0) will be allocated to either an intervention group or a passive wait list control group. The intervention group will perform 60 min of combined functional resistance and endurance exercises 3x per week over a period of 12 weeks in a community-based and publicly available setting. Changes in serum concentration of MMP-2 will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are numbers of immune cell subsets, soluble (anti-) inflammatory factors, physical capacity, cognitive performance, physical activity behavior, gait performance, and patient-reported outcomes. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after week 12 with an additional blood sampling before, during and immediately after a single training session in week 6.


DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of a community-based intense functional resistance and endurance exercise regimen in persons with RRMS. Combining analysis of biological and cognitive or psychological outcomes may provide a better understanding of the MS-specific symptomology.

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide and characteristically accompanied by downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling emerges to attenuate neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke; however, its effect on modulating microglial polarization is largely unknown. Here, we explored whether Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator TWS119 facilitated long-term neurological recovery via modulating microglia polarization after experimental stroke.


METHODS
Ischemic stroke mice model was induced by permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion plus 1 h hypoxia. TWS119 was administrated from day 1 to 14 after stroke. Neurological deficits were monitored up to 21 days after stroke. Angiogenesis, neural plasticity, microglial polarization, and microglia-associated inflammatory cytokines were detected in the peri-infarct cortex at days 14 and 21 after stroke. Primary microglia and mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell lines were employed to explore the underlying mechanism in vitro.


RESULTS
TWS119 mitigated neurological deficits at days 14 and 21 after experimental stroke, paralleled by acceleration on angiogenesis and neural plasticity in the peri-infarct cortex. Mechanistically, cerebral ischemia induced production of microglia-associated proinflammatory cytokines and priming of activated microglia toward pro-inflammatory polarization, whereas TWS119 ameliorated microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory status following ischemic stroke and promoted angiogenesis by modulating microglia to anti-inflammatory phenotype. The beneficial efficacy of TWS119 in microglial polarization was largely reversed by selective Wnt/β-catenin pathway blockade in vitro, suggesting that TWS119-enabled pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotype switch of microglia was possibly mediated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator TWS119 ameliorated neuroinflammatory microenvironment following chronic cerebral ischemia via modulating microglia towards anti-inflammatory phenotype, and facilitates neurological recovery in an anti-inflammatory phenotype polarization-dependent manner. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway following ischemic stroke might be a potential restorative strategy targeting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.",Xiangjian Zhang;Junmin Chen;Xiaoxia Liu;Jing Xue;Lan Zhang;Xifa Lan
57,Paola Pontecorvi,"BACKGROUND
Astrocytes contribute to the crosstalk that generates chronic neuro-inflammation in neurological diseases; however, compared with microglia, astrocytes respond to a more limited continuum of innate immune system stimulants. Recent studies suggest that the fibrinolysis system may regulate inflammation. The goal of this study was to test whether fibrinolysis system components activate astrocytes and if so, elucidate the responsible biochemical pathway.


METHODS
Primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia were prepared from neonatal mouse brains. The ability of purified fibrinolysis system proteins to elicit a pro-inflammatory response was determined by measuring expression of the mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). IκBα phosphorylation also was measured. Plasminogen activation in association with cells was detected by chromogenic substrate hydrolysis. The activity of specific receptors was tested using neutralizing antibodies and reagents.


RESULTS
Astrocytes expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines when treated with plasminogen but not when treated with agonists for Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4), TLR2, or TLR9. Microglia also expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to plasminogen; however, in these cells, the response was observed only when tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was added to activate plasminogen. In astrocytes, endogenously produced urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) converted plasminogen into plasmin in the absence of tPA. Plasminogen activation was dependent on the plasminogen receptor, α-enolase, and the uPA receptor, uPAR. Although uPAR is capable of directly activating cell-signaling, the receptor responsible for cytokine expression and IκBα phosphorylation response to plasmin was Protease-activated Receptor-1 (PAR-1). The pathway, by which plasminogen induced astrocyte activation, was blocked by inhibiting any one of the three receptors implicated in this pathway with reagents such as εACA, α-enolase-specific antibody, uPAR-specific antibody, the uPA amino terminal fragment, or a pharmacologic PAR-1 inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasminogen may activate astrocytes for pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the concerted action of at least three distinct fibrinolysis protease receptors. The pathway is dependent on uPA to activate plasminogen, which is expressed endogenously by astrocytes in culture but also may be provided by other cells in the astrocytic cell microenvironment in the CNS.",Michael A Banki;Carlotta Zampieri;Cristina Zalfa;Pardis Azmoon;Maria Z Kounnas;Cinzia Marchese;Steven L Gonias;Elisabetta Mantuano
58,Roberta Magliozzi,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies of cortical pathology in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis have shown that a more severe clinical course and the presence of extended subpial grey matter lesions with significant neuronal/glial loss and microglial activation are associated with meningeal inflammation, including the presence of lymphoid-like structures in the subarachnoid space in a proportion of cases.


METHODS
To investigate the molecular consequences of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules diffusing from the meninges into the underlying grey matter, we carried out gene expression profiling analysis of the motor cortex from 20 post-mortem multiple sclerosis brains with and without substantial meningeal inflammation and 10 non-neurological controls.


RESULTS
Gene expression profiling of grey matter lesions and normal appearing grey matter not only confirmed the substantial pathological cell changes, which were greatest in multiple sclerosis cases with increased meningeal inflammation, but also demonstrated the upregulation of multiple genes/pathways associated with the inflammatory response. In particular, genes involved in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling were significantly deregulated in MS cases compared with controls. Increased meningeal inflammation was found to be associated with a shift in the balance of TNF signalling away from TNFR1/TNFR2 and NFkB-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways towards TNFR1- and RIPK3-mediated pro-apoptotic/pro-necroptotic signalling in the grey matter, which was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. TNFR1 was found expressed preferentially on neurons and oligodendrocytes in MS cortical grey matter, whereas TNFR2 was predominantly expressed by astrocytes and microglia.


CONCLUSIONS
We suggest that the inflammatory milieu generated in the subarachnoid space of the multiple sclerosis meninges by infiltrating immune cells leads to increased demyelinating and neurodegenerative pathology in the underlying grey matter due to changes in the balance of TNF signalling.",Owain William Howell;Pascal Durrenberger;Eleonora Aricò;Rachel James;Carolina Cruciani;Cheryl Reeves;Federico Roncaroli;Richard Nicholas;Richard Reynolds
59,Andro Montoya,"BACKGROUND
Neuroinflammation constitutes a pathogenic process leading to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) and sepsis. Despite microglial cells being the central players in neuroinflammation, astrocytes play a key regulatory role in this process. Our previous results indicated that pharmacologic-antagonism or genetic deficiency of dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) attenuated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in two mouse models of PD. Here, we studied how DRD3-signalling affects the dynamic of activation of microglia and astrocyte in the context of systemic inflammation.


METHODS
Neuroinflammation was induced by intraperitoneal administration of LPS. The effect of genetic DRD3-deficiency or pharmacologic DRD3-antagonism in the functional phenotype of astrocytes and microglia was determined by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at different time-points.


RESULTS
Our results show that DRD3 was expressed in astrocytes, but not in microglial cells. DRD3 deficiency resulted in unresponsiveness of astrocytes and in attenuated microglial activation upon systemic inflammation. Furthermore, similar alterations in the functional phenotypes of glial cells were observed by DRD3 antagonism and genetic deficiency of DRD3 upon LPS challenge. Mechanistic analyses show that DRD3 deficiency resulted in exacerbated expression of the anti-inflammatory protein Fizz1 in glial cells both in vitro and in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that DRD3 signalling regulates the dynamic of the acquisition of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory features by astrocytes and microglia, finally favouring microglial activation and promoting neuroinflammation.",Daniela Elgueta;Javier Campos;Ornella Chovar;Paulina Falcón;Soledad Matus;Iván Alfaro;María Rosa Bono;Rodrigo Pacheco
60,Grant S Shields,"Fueling the rapid growth in our understanding of how stress influences cognition, the number of studies examining the effects of stress on various cognitive processes has grown substantially over the last two decades. Despite this growth, few published guidelines exist for designing these studies, and divergent paradigm designs can diminish typical effects of stress or even reverse them. The goal of this review, therefore, is to survey necessary considerations (e.g., validating a stress induction), important considerations (e.g., specifying the timing of the stressor and cognitive task), and best practices (e.g., using Bayesian analyses) when designing a study that aims at least in part to examine the effects of acute stress on some cognitive process or function. These guidelines will also serve to help readers of these studies interpret what may otherwise be very confusing, anomalous results. Designing and interpreting studies with these considerations and practices in mind will help to move the field of stress and cognition forward by clarifying how, exactly, stress influences performance on a given cognitive task in a population of interest.",NA

Paroxysmal tonic upgaze (PTU), defined as an involuntary upward movement of the eyes, has been considered as a benign phenomenon but may also be associated with ataxia and developmental delay.


METHODS
We report eight children with PTU; six of them also exhibiting symptoms of ataxia and/or developmental delay. Treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibition was offered to children with persisting and/or severe forms.


RESULTS
Whole-exome sequencing and genome-wide array analysis (n = 7) did not reveal mutations in the three known genes associated with PTU (CACNA1A, GRID2, SEPSECS), whereas by MLPA a heterozygous deletion of exon 31 of the CACNA1A gene could be detected in one patient, her mother and two further family members. Further exome and array analysis showed no recurrent variants in potentially novel PTU-related genes in more than one patient. A de novo variant at a highly conserved position in the SIM1 gene was detected in one patient, for which a pathogenic effect could be speculated. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition was started in five children and proved at least partially effective in all of them.

62,Anup D Patel,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy.


METHODS
This was an interim analysis (cut-off March 15, 2017) of pooled data from two open-label, single-arm, multicentre trials. N01263 (NCT00422422) was a 3-week trial of BRV 0.8-4 mg/kg/day in patients (1 month-<16 years) with epilepsy. Patients who completed this trial could continue into a long-term follow-up trial (N01266, NCT01364597) which also directly enrolled patients (4-<17 years) with focal seizures. After dose-escalation, patients received BRV 1-5 mg/kg/day (maximum 200 mg/day) during long-term evaluation. Data are reported for patients aged 4 to <16 years with focal seizures.


RESULTS
The safety set comprised 149 patients: 34 from the initial trial (26 entered long-term trial) and 115 directly enrolled into the long-term trial. At the cut-off, 90 patients were receiving BRV (total exposure: 299.4 patient-years). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 140/149 (94.0%) patients, most commonly (≥20%) nasopharyngitis (24.8%), pharyngitis (22.1%), convulsion (21.5%), and pyrexia (20.1%). TEAEs considered drug-related by the investigator were reported by 56/149 (37.6%) patients, most commonly somnolence (6.0%). Two patients died; neither death was considered related to BRV. Mean changes from baseline in child behaviour rating scales were small; most patients remained in their baseline category.


CONCLUSION
In this pooled analysis of two open-label trials including long-term data, adjunctive BRV was generally well tolerated in children aged 4 to <16 years with focal seizures. These findings supported approval of BRV as a new therapy option for children aged ≥4 years with focal seizures.",Vincent Badalamenti;Teresa Gasalla;Sami Elmoufti;Jan-Peer Elshoff
63,Irene Rosas,"We analyzed the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in the ATXN1, ATXN2, and HTT genes in several neurodegenerative diseases. The study included 1126 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 440 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 610 patients with Parkinson's disease. In all cohorts, we genotyped ATXN1 and ATXN2 CAG repeats. In addition, in the FTD cohort, we determined the number of HTT CAG repeats. The frequency of HTT IAs was higher in patients with FTD (6.9%) versus controls (2.9%) and in the C9orf72 expansion noncarriers (7.2%) versus controls (2.9%), although the difference was nonsignificant after correction for multiple testing. Compared with controls, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) groups showed a significantly higher frequency of HTT IAs (13.6% vs. 2.9% controls). For the ATXN2 gene, we observed an increase in IA frequency in AD cases (AD 4.1% vs. controls 1.8%) and in the behavioral FTD group (4.8% vs. 1.8%). For the ATXN1 gene, we found a significant increase of IAs in patients with PNFA (18.6%) versus controls (6.7%).

64,Katrina M Moore,"BACKGROUND
Frontotemporal dementia is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, with about a third of cases being genetic. Most of this genetic component is accounted for by mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72. In this study, we aimed to complement previous phenotypic studies by doing an international study of age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration in individuals with mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72.


METHODS
In this international, retrospective cohort study, we collected data on age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration for patients with pathogenic mutations in the GRN and MAPT genes and pathological expansions in the C9orf72 gene through the Frontotemporal Dementia Prevention Initiative and from published papers. We used mixed effects models to explore differences in age at onset, age at death, and disease duration between genetic groups and individual mutations. We also assessed correlations between the age at onset and at death of each individual and the age at onset and at death of their parents and the mean age at onset and at death of their family members. Lastly, we used mixed effects models to investigate the extent to which variability in age at onset and at death could be accounted for by family membership and the specific mutation carried.


FINDINGS
Data were available from 3403 individuals from 1492 families: 1433 with C9orf72 expansions (755 families), 1179 with GRN mutations (483 families, 130 different mutations), and 791 with MAPT mutations (254 families, 67 different mutations). Mean age at symptom onset and at death was 49·5 years (SD 10·0; onset) and 58·5 years (11·3; death) in the MAPT group, 58·2 years (9·8; onset) and 65·3 years (10·9; death) in the C9orf72 group, and 61·3 years (8·8; onset) and 68·8 years (9·7; death) in the GRN group. Mean disease duration was 6·4 years (SD 4·9) in the C9orf72 group, 7·1 years (3·9) in the GRN group, and 9·3 years (6·4) in the MAPT group. Individual age at onset and at death was significantly correlated with both parental age at onset and at death and with mean family age at onset and at death in all three groups, with a stronger correlation observed in the MAPT group (r=0·45 between individual and parental age at onset, r=0·63 between individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·58 between individual and parental age at death, and r=0·69 between individual and mean family age at death) than in either the C9orf72 group (r=0·32 individual and parental age at onset, r=0·36 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·38 individual and parental age at death, and r=0·40 individual and mean family age at death) or the GRN group (r=0·22 individual and parental age at onset, r=0·18 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·22 individual and parental age at death, and r=0·32 individual and mean family age at death). Modelling showed that the variability in age at onset and at death in the MAPT group was explained partly by the specific mutation (48%, 95% CI 35-62, for age at onset; 61%, 47-73, for age at death), and even more by family membership (66%, 56-75, for age at onset; 74%, 65-82, for age at death). In the GRN group, only 2% (0-10) of the variability of age at onset and 9% (3-21) of that of age of death was explained by the specific mutation, whereas 14% (9-22) of the variability of age at onset and 20% (12-30) of that of age at death was explained by family membership. In the C9orf72 group, family membership explained 17% (11-26) of the variability of age at onset and 19% (12-29) of that of age at death.


INTERPRETATION
Our study showed that age at symptom onset and at death of people with genetic frontotemporal dementia is influenced by genetic group and, particularly for MAPT mutations, by the specific mutation carried and by family membership. Although estimation of age at onset will be an important factor in future pre-symptomatic therapeutic trials for all three genetic groups, our study suggests that data from other members of the family will be particularly helpful only for individuals with MAPT mutations. Further work in identifying both genetic and environmental factors that modify phenotype in all groups will be important to improve such estimates.

65,Yonil Jung,"Innate behaviors involve both reflexive motor programs and enduring internal states, but how these responses are coordinated by the brain is not clear. In Drosophila, male-specific P1 interneurons promote courtship song, as well as a persistent internal state that prolongs courtship and enhances aggressiveness. However, P1 neurons themselves are not persistently active. Here, we identify pCd neurons as persistently active, indirect P1 targets that are required for P1-evoked persistent courtship and aggression. Acute activation of pCd neurons alone is inefficacious but enhances and prolongs courtship or aggression promoted by female cues. Brief female exposure induces a persistent increase in male aggressiveness, an effect abrogated by interruption of pCd activity. pCd activity is not sufficient but necessary for persistent physiological activity, implying an essential role in a persistence network. Thus, P1 neurons coordinate both command-like control of courtship song and a persistent internal state of social arousal mediated by pCd neurons.",Ann Kennedy;Hui Chiu;Farhan Mohammad;Adam Claridge-Chang;David J Anderson

Post-embryonically, epigenetic signaling within neurons has been associated with impaired learning, autism, ataxia, and schizophrenia. Epigenetic factors are also enriched in glial cells. However, little is known about epigenetic signaling in glia and nothing is known about the intersection of glial epigenetic signaling and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. During a screen for genes involved in presynaptic homeostatic synaptic plasticity, we identified an essential role for the histone acetyltransferase and deubiquitinase SAGA complex in peripheral glia. We present evidence that the SAGA complex is necessary for homeostatic plasticity, demonstrating involvement of four new genes in homeostatic plasticity. This is also evidence that glia participate in presynaptic homeostatic plasticity, invoking previously unexplored intercellular, homeostatic signaling at a tripartite synapse. We show, mechanistically, SAGA signaling regulates the composition of and signaling from the extracellular matrix during homeostatic plasticity.",Danielle T Morency;Nathan Harris;Graeme W Davis

Here we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in awake head-fixed mice to assess the role of spontaneous vasomotion in paravascular clearance. Vasomotion correlated with paravascular clearance of fluorescent dextran from the interstitial fluid. Increasing the amplitude of vasomotion by means of visually evoked vascular responses resulted in increased clearance rates in the visual cortex of awake mice. Evoked vascular reactivity was impaired in mice with CAA, which corresponded to slower clearance rates. Our findings suggest that low-frequency arteriolar oscillations drive drainage of solutes.

68,Silvia Torretta,"Multiple schizophrenia (SCZ) risk loci may be involved in gene co-regulation mechanisms, and analysis of co-expressed gene networks may help to clarify SCZ molecular basis. We have previously identified a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) co-expression module enriched for SCZ risk genes and associated with cognitive and neuroimaging phenotypes of SCZ, as well as with response to treatment with antipsychotics. Here we aimed to identify regulatory factors modulating this co-expression module and their relevance to SCZ.We performed motif enrichment analysis to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites in human promoters of genes co-expressed with DRD2. Then, we measured transcript levels of a group of these genes in primary mouse cortical neurons in basal conditions and upon overexpression and knockdown of predicted TFs. Finally, we analyzed expression levels of these TFs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ patients.Our in silico analysis revealed enrichment for NURR1 and ERR1 binding sites. In neuronal cultures, the expression of genes either relevant to SCZ risk (Drd2, Gatad2a, Slc28a1, Cnr1) or indexing co-expression in our module (Btg4, Chit1, Osr1, Gpld1) was significantly modified by gain and loss of Nurr1 and Err1. Postmortem DLPFC expression data analysis showed decreased expression levels of NURR1 and ERR1 in patients with SCZ. For NURR1 such decreased expression is associated with treatment with antipsychotics.Our results show that NURR1 and ERR1 modulate the transcription of DRD2 co-expression partners and support the hypothesis that NURR1 is involved in the response to SCZ treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn the present study, we provide in silico and experimental evidence for a role of the TFs NURR1 and ERR1 in modulating the expression pattern of genes co-expressed with DRD2 in human DLPFC. Notably, genetic variations in these genes is associated with SCZ risk and behavioral and neuroimaging phenotypes of the disease, as well as with response to treatment.

69,Konstantina Kilteni,"Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen we touch our hand with the other, the resulting sensation feels less intense than when another person or a machine touches our hand with the same intensity. Early computational motor control theories have proposed that the cerebellum predicts and cancels the sensory consequences of our movements; however, the neural correlates of this cancelation remain unknown. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the more participants attenuate the perception of their self-generated touch, the stronger the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortical areas. This provides conclusive evidence about the role of the cerebellum in predicting the sensory feedback of our movements and in attenuating the associated percepts via its connections to early somatosensory areas.",H Henrik Ehrsson
70,Zachary A Abecassis,"Within the basal ganglia circuit, the external globus pallidus (GPe) is critically involved in motor control. Aside from Foxp2+ neurons and ChAT+ neurons that have been established as unique neuron types, there is little consensus on the classification of GPe neurons. Properties of the remaining neuron types are poorly-defined. In this study, we leverage new mouse lines, viral tools, and molecular markers to better define GPe neuron subtypes. We found that Sox6 represents a novel, defining marker for GPe neuron subtypes. Lhx6+ neurons that lack the expression of Sox6 were devoid of both parvalbumin and Npas1. This result confirms previous assertions of the existence of a unique Lhx6+ population. Neurons that arise from the Dbx1+ lineage were similarly abundant in the GPe and displayed a heterogeneous makeup. Importantly, tracing experiments revealed that Npas1+-Nkx2.1+ neurons represent the principal non-cholinergic, cortically-projecting neurons. In other words, they form the pallido-cortical arm of the cortico-pallido-cortical loop. Our data further described that pyramidal-tract neurons in the cortex collateralized within the GPe, forming a closed-loop system between the two brain structures. Overall, our findings reconcile some of the discrepancies that arose from differences in techniques or the reliance on pre-existing tools. While spatial distribution and electrophysiological properties of GPe neurons reaffirm the diversification of GPe subtypes, statistical analyses strongly support the notion that these neuron subtypes can be categorized under the two principal neuron classes-i.e., PV+ neurons and Npas1+ neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe poor understanding of the neuronal composition in the GPe undermines our ability to interrogate its precise behavioral and disease involvements. In this study, twelve different genetic crosses were used, hundreds of neurons were electrophysiologically-characterized, and over 100,000 neurons were histologically- and/or anatomically-profiled. Our current study further establishes the segregation of GPe neuron classes and illustrates the complexity of GPe neurons in adult mice. Our results support the idea that Npas1+-Nkx2.1+ neurons are a distinct GPe neuron subclass. By providing a detailed analysis of the organization of the cortico-pallidal-cortical projection, our findings establish the cellular and circuit substrates that can be important for motor function and dysfunction.",Brianna L Berceau;Phyo H Win;Daniela Garcia;Harry S Xenias;Qiaoling Cui;Arin Pamukcu;Suraj Cherian;Vivian M Hernández;Uree Chon;Byung Kook Lim;Yongsoo Kim;Nicholas J Justice;Raj Awatramani;Bryan M Hooks;Charles R Gerfen;Simina M Boca;C Savio Chan
71,Alvaro Campero,"Gravity retraction is an underutilized adjunct in neurosurgery. Gravity is gentler than retractor blades; it does not cause brain edema or injury, and it tends to open natural subarachnoidal plans to deep lesions.1-3 A good example of this is the supracerebellar infratrochlear approach4-7 in semisitting position for resection to a midbrain cavernous malformation. This approach was selected because the cavernous malformation was 1 mm under the lateral mesencephalic sulcus.

72,Joseph Haynes,"We present a patient who was diagnosed 20 yr prior to current presentation with a spinal arteriovenous malformation. This patient had a 10-yr history of worsening back pain (and underwent lumbar fusion), urinary dysfunction leading to 3-yr dependence on intermittent catheterization, lower extremity paresthesias and pain, and progressive weakness with multiple falls, leading to walker then wheelchair dependence for mobility. Magnetic resonance studies showed extensive thoracic cord expansion and edema with enlarged spinal cord surface veins and flow voids extending from spinal levels T6 to the conus medullaris. Partial embolization at an outside institution elicited transient symptom improvement. Repeated spinal angiogram demonstrated persistent T10 pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) supplied by the posterior spinal artery arising from the right T11 segmental artery as well as by the anterior spinal artery from the left T10 segmental artery. Because additional embolization carried significant risk, we planned open surgery with fistula resection. Informed consent for the surgery and video recording was obtained. The patient was placed in the prone position, and a radial artery access was obtained for intraoperative angiogram. Following a posterior T9-T11 laminectomy and dural opening, a pial dissection was performed to expose the AVF. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography was used to assist in identifying the feeders and major drainage of the AVF. Post-AVF resection, a formal intraoperative radial access spinal angiogram demonstrated complete resection of the lesion with no residual shunt or early venous drainage. The patient improved significantly and, on last follow-up, is ambulating without any assistive devices.",Maksim Shapiro;Eytan Raz;Anthony Frempong-Boadu;Erez Nossek
73,Jason I Liounakos,"Minimally invasive spine surgery has the potential to reduce soft tissue destruction, blood loss, postoperative pain, and overall perioperative morbidity while accelerating recovery. Robotic guidance systems are relatively new tools in the minimally invasive surgeon's armamentarium, striving to increase accuracy of instrumentation placement, decrease complications, reduce radiation burden, and enhance surgical ergonomics in order to improve efficiency and maximize patient outcomes. We present the case of a 78-yr-old male with intractable lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain with multilevel degenerative spondylosis. The procedure performed was a L3-5 robotic-assisted endoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) utilizing the Mazor X robotic guidance system (Medtronic) for both percutaneous pedicle screw placement, as well as trajectory localization for endoscopic discectomy and percutaneous interbody delivery. Previously, clinical and radiographic success has been published regarding the awake, endoscopic TLIF.1 We document the first use of robotic guidance for disc space localization and its combination with endoscopy to achieve interbody fusion, utilizing an expandable, allograft-filled mesh interbody device.2 This video demonstrates appropriate patient positioning, work flow for this unique technique, and the benefits of using robotic guidance to plan and execute percutaneous trajectories through Kambin's triangle.

74,Albert McAnsah Isaacs,"BACKGROUND
Determining an optimal location within the right atrium (RA) for placement of the distal ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt catheter offer several operative challenges that place patients at risk for perioperative complications and downstream VA shunt failure. Utilizing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance to place distal VA shunt catheters may help to circumvent these risks.


OBJECTIVE
To review our current practice of VA shunt insertion using TEE guidance.


METHODS
A retrospective review of all consecutive patients who underwent VA shunt procedures between December 19, 2016 and January 22, 2019, during which time intraoperative TEE was used for shunt placement was performed. Data on the time required for shunt placement and total procedure time, baseline echocardiography findings, and short- and long-term complications of shunt placement were assessed.


RESULTS
A total of 33 patients underwent VA shunt procedures, with a median follow-up time of 250 (88-412) d. The only immediate complication related to shunt placement or TEE use was transient ectopy in 1 patient. The mean time for atrial catheter insertion was 12.6 ± 4.8 min. Right-heart catheters were inserted between the RA-superior vena cava junction and 22 mm within the RA in all but 3 procedures. A total of 7/33 patients (21%) underwent shunt revision. Indications for revisions included distal clots, proximal obstruction, positive blood culture, and shunt valve revision. No other complications of VA shunt insertion were reported.


CONCLUSION
VA shunt insertion using TEE allows for precise distal catheter placement. Early patient experience confirms this technique has a low complication rate.",Danae Krahn;Andrew M Walker;Heather Hurdle;Mark G Hamilton
75,Qazi Zeeshan,"This 42-yr-old man presented with a history of sudden right-sided facial and right arm weakness and dysarthria. Head computed tomography showed a left frontal-parietal blood clot. An intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a left subcortical postcentral, Spetzler-Martin Grade 3 arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a diffuse nidus, measuring 2.1 × 1.5 cm, supplied by branches of the left MCA, and draining into a cortical vein and a deep vein, which was going toward the ventricle. Preoperative embolization was not possible.  The patient underwent left frontal-parietal craniotomy with intraoperative motor and sensory mapping. No arterialized veins were visible on the cortical surface. Neuronavigation localized the AVM in the subcortical postcentral gyrus. Through an incision in the postcentral sulcus, microdissection led to a yellowish gliotic plane. The large cortical vein was in the gliotic area and traced to the AVM. Circumferential microdissection was performed around the AVM. It had a very diffuse nidus; the arterial feeders were cauterized and divided, and the superior superficial and inferior deep draining veins were finally occluded, and AVM was removed.  Postoperative angiogram showed total removal of the AVM. At discharge, his right arm weakness had improved (power 5/5), and facial weakness and dysarthria were improving (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 2). At 1-yr follow-up, facial weakness and dysarthria had improved considerably, and patient returned to work (mRS 1).  This video shows microsurgical resection of an AVM by neuronavigation and tracing of the subcortical draining vein. The technique of cauterizing the perforating arteries after temporary clipping with flow arrest is shown in the video. Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the surgery that included videotaping of the procedure and its distribution for educational purposes.

76,Mirza Pojskić,"In this video, we demonstrate microsurgical resection of IV ventricle subependymoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video case report of a microsurgical resection of subependymoma of the IV ventricle in the peer-reviewed English literature. Subependymomas are benign central nervous system tumors, typically arising in ventricular spaces, mostly in the IV and lateral ventricles.1-3 They are isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with minimal or no enhancement.4 Microsurgery remains the mainstay treatment. Complete tumor resection is possible and curative with excellent prognosis.1,5-7 Although the clinical course appears benign, the inability to diagnose them radiographically with certainty and the possibility of an alternative malignant lesion support a low threshold for early and safe resection.8 A 39-yr-old man presented with severe headache and balance problems. Pre- and postcontrast neuroaxis MRI revealed a centrally located IV ventricle lesion without hydrocephalus. The aim of the surgery was complete tumor resection. Surgery was performed in the prone position by the senior author (KIA) with intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring. A small suboccipital craniotomy and C1 posterior arch removal was done. After opening the dura and arachnoid membrane, the tumor was identified and meticulously dissected from the adjacent posterior inferior cerebellar artery and the floor of the fourth ventricle and from brain stem white matter at the tumor-neural tissue interface to avoid brainstem interference.

77,Nitesh V Patel,"Fusiform aneurysms remain challenging entities to treat, as maintenance of flow and prevention of branch occlusion are concerns. Use of endovascular stents may risk nearby branch occlusion. We present a 31-yr-old male with a prior subarachnoid hemorrhage from a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 aneurysm. Informed consent for use of the operative video and information was obtained from the patient. Initially, open clipping was performed with noted residual because of risk of nearby branches. On angiography, a growing fusiform segment distal to the initial aneurysm was noted. The patient was referred to our institution for this finding, and a multidisciplinary team reviewed the case. Endovascular treatment was felt to be risky, as stenting could jail nearby MCA branches. Clipping would also risk occlusion because of scaring from previous hemorrhage. Sufficient flow would be needed, and because the ipsilateral superficial temporal artery was sacrificed in the initial craniotomy, the internal maxillary artery (IMAX) was chosen as the bypass source. A cerebrovascular neurosurgeon, skull base otolaryngologist, and vascular surgeon worked together to perform a left-side IMAX to MCA bypass using an anterior tibial artery graft under 3-dimensional exoscopic visualization. Specifically, a 9-0 nylon suture on a BV-130 needle along with straight and tying forceps were used along with heparinized saline. The bypass was noted to be of robust flow, and the patient did very well on postoperative follow-up. The utilization of an anterior tibial artery graft, IMAX exposure, and corresponding bypass provides educational value, as there are only a limited number of videos on this topic.",Barbara Ligas;Shashank Gandhi;Jason Ellis;Rafael Ortiz;Peter Costantino;Khalil Qato;David J Langer
78,Samuel G McClugage,"PURPOSE
Delayed intracranial hypertension (DIH) occurs most frequently in children with syndromic or multi-suture synostosis after surgical correction. The rarity of DIH in children with isolated non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (ISS) warrants follow-up evaluation by large craniofacial centers until skeletal maturity. This study reports the incidence of DIH in children following open repair for ISS by our center's craniofacial team.


METHODS
A single-center retrospective study of patients who underwent open calvarial vault remodeling (CVR) for ISS at our institution between November 2000 and November 2012 was performed. Syndromic and multi-suture synostosis patients were excluded. Demographic and follow-up data were extracted from the medical record for analysis until July 2017.


RESULTS
One hundred five patients with ISS were identified who had undergone CVR in the aforementioned timeframe. Average age at initial surgery was 11.7 ± 15.32 months. Mean follow-up in our craniofacial clinic was 4.94 ± 3.53 years, with 69 patients (65.7%) having follow-up in craniofacial clinic ≥ 3 years and 74 (70.5%) having follow-up ≥ 3 years in any clinic at our institution. Four patients (3.8%) had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors placed for symptoms concerning for DIH, one of which (0.95%) had confirmed DIH and underwent a second surgical procedure at 7.4 years of age. The patient presented late initially, having his first operation at 1.56 years of age.


CONCLUSION
One patient out of 105 (0.95%) developed DIH, confirmed by ICP monitoring, and required reoperation. The occurrence of DIH, albeit rare, remains an important topic to include in parental discussions and mandates long-term follow-up in this population.",Jacob R Lepard;Peter D Ray;John H Grant;Jeffrey P Blount;Curtis J Rozzelle;James M Johnston
79,Chan Lin,"Stomatopod crustaceans possess tripartite compound eyes; upper and lower hemispheres are separated by an equatorial midband of several ommatidial rows. The organization of stomatopod retinas is well established, but their optic lobes have been studied less. We used histological staining, immunolabeling, and fluorescent tracer injections to compare optic lobes in two 6-row midband species, Neogonodactylus oerstedii and Pseudosquilla ciliata, to those in two 2-row midband species, Squilla empusa and Alima pacifica. Compared to the 6-row species, we found structural differences in all optic neuropils in both 2-row species. Photoreceptor axons from 2-row midband ommatidia supply two sets of lamina cartridges; however, conspicuous spaces lacking lamina cartridges are observed in locations corresponding to where the cartridges of the upper four ommatidial rows of 6-row species would exist. The tripartite arrangement and enlarged projections containing fibers associated with the two rows of midband ommatidia can be traced throughout the entire optic lobe. However, 2-row species lack some features of medullar and lobular neuropils in 6-row species. Our results support the hypothesis that 2-row midband species are derived from a 6-row ancestor, and suggest specializations in the medulla and lobula found solely in 6-row species are important for color and polarization analysis.",Alice Chou;Thomas W Cronin
80,Karen Y Cheng,"Insects use vision to choose from a repertoire of flexible behaviors which they perform for survival. Decisions for behavioral plasticity are achieved through the neuromodulation of sensory processes, including motion vision. Here, we briefly review the anatomy of the insect motion vision system. Next, we review the neuromodulatory influences on motion vision. Serotonin modulates peripheral visual processing, whereas octopamine modulates all stages of visual processing tested to date. The physiological and behavioral states that elicit neuromodulation of motion vision include locomotion, changes in internal physiological state such as hunger, and changes in the external environment such as the presence of additional sensory cues. The direction of influence between these states and neuromodulators remains unknown. The influence of neuromodulators on motion vision circuitry has been revealed mostly through pharmacological application, which broadcasts widely with unnatural spatiotemporal dynamics. Thus, insight from this method is limited. Aminergic neurons likely act in local hierarchical fashion rather than globally as a group. As genetic tools advance in Drosophila, future work restricting the experimental focus to subpopulations of modulatory neurons will provide insight into the local functional modifications of visual circuits by interacting neuromodulators.",Mark A Frye
81,Gizem Sancer,"Specialized ommatidia harboring polarization-sensitive photoreceptors exist in the 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of virtually all insects. Although downstream elements have been described both anatomically and physiologically throughout the optic lobes and the central brain of different species, little is known about their cellular and synaptic adaptations and how these shape their functional role in polarization vision. We have previously shown that in the DRA of Drosophila melanogaster, two distinct types of modality-specific 'distal medulla' cell types (Dm-DRA1 and Dm-DRA2) are post-synaptic to long visual fiber photoreceptors R7 and R8, respectively. Here we describe additional neuronal elements in the medulla neuropil that manifest modality-specific differences in the DRA region, including DRA-specific neuronal morphology, as well as differences in the structure of pre- or post-synaptic membranes. Furthermore, we show that certain cell types (medulla tangential cells and octopaminergic neuromodulatory cells) specifically avoid contacts with polarization-sensitive photoreceptors. Finally, while certain transmedullary cells are specifically absent from DRA medulla columns, other subtypes show specific wiring differences while still connecting the DRA to the lobula complex, as has previously been described in larger insects. This hints towards a complex circuit architecture with more than one pathway connecting polarization-sensitive DRA photoreceptors with the central brain.",Emil Kind;Juliane Uhlhorn;Julia Volkmann;Johannes Hammacher;Tuyen Pham;Haritz Plazaola-Sasieta;Mathias F Wernet
82,Chao Deng,"Pramipexole (PPX) is a common drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism allows PPX in the progression of Parkinson's disease remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of PPX in 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated neuroblastoma cells and explore the interaction between PPX and miR-494-3p/brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) axis. SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells challenged by MPP+ were used as cellular model of Parkinson's disease and incubated with PPX. The expression levels of miR-494-3p and BDNF were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Neurotoxicity was investigated by cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. The target association between miR-494-3p and BDNF was confirmed by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. miR-494-3p expression was increased and BDNF level was decreased in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells, which were reversed by introduction of PPX. Pramipexole attenuated cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells. Knockdown of miR-494-3p also suppressed neurotoxicity induced by MPP+ in SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells. BDNF was validated as a target of miR-494-3p and its silence abated the suppressive effect of miR-494-3p on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, addition of miR-494-3p and silence of BDNF mitigated the effect of PPX on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. PPX inhibited MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH and CHP 212 cells by decreasing miR-494-3p and increasing BDNF, indicating the potential therapeutic effect of PPX on Parkinson's disease.",Jianping Zhu;Junlan Yuan;Yong Xiang;Li Dai
83,Franklin Lima,"BACKGROUND
Surgical access to the second (V2, maxillary) and third (V3, mandibular) branches of the trigeminal nerve (V) has been classically through a transoral approach. Increasing expertise with endoscopic anatomy has achieved less invasive, more efficient access to skull base structures. The authors present a surgical technique using an endoscopic endonasal approach for the treatment of painful V2 neuropathy.


METHODS
Endoscopic endonasal dissections using a transmaxillary approach were performed in four formalin-fixed cadaver heads to expose the V2 branch of the trigeminal nerve. Relevant surgical anatomy was evaluated and anatomic parameters for neurectomy were identified.


RESULTS
Endoscopic endonasal transmaxillary approaches completed bilaterally to the pterygopalatine and pterygomaxillary fossae exposed the V2 branch where it emerged from the foramen rotundum. The anatomy defined for the location of neurectomy was determined to be the point where V2 emerged from the foramen rotundum into the pterygopalatine fossa. The technique was then performed in 3 patients with intractable painful V2 neuropathy.


CONCLUSIONS
In our cadaveric study and clinical cases, the endoscopic endonasal approach to the pterygopalatine fossa achieved effective exposure and treatment of isolated V2 painful neuropathy. Important surgical steps to visualize the maxillary nerve and its branches and key landmarks of the pterygopalatine fossa are discussed. This minimally invasive approach appears to be a valid alternative for select patients with painful V2 trigeminal neuropathy.",Norberto Andaluz;Lee A Zimmer
84,Sotirios Katsigiannis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
To evaluate posterolateral myelotomy (PLM) as a surgical method for all cases of intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT) by assessing the surgical and functional outcomes of patients treated in our clinic.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with IMSCT who underwent surgery using PLM from 2013 to 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Objective and quantitative assessment of the preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up neurological status was performed by using the modified McCormick functional schema and sensory pain scale.


RESULTS
A total of 33 operations were performed on 27 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The mean grade on the McCormick functional schema increased insignificantly from 2.0 preoperatively to 2.3 immediately postoperatively and decreased back to 2.1 at the follow-up examination. Just one patient exhibited a transient proprioception deficit. Significant pain relief was observed as expressed in an improvement of mean grade on the sensory pain scale. Only in two cases was late neuropathic pain reported. A gross total resection/subtotal resection (GTR/STR) was achieved in all cases of hemangioblastoma and cavernoma, while for the majority of astrocytomas, only partial removal was accomplished. For ependymoma, which represents the most common IMSCT, a GTR/STR was realized in 12 cases (86%). A statistically significant difference (p = 0.027) was found when comparing the extent of tumor resection (EOR) between the two most common IMSCT, i.e., ependymoma and astrocytoma.


CONCLUSION
PLM may be considered a reliable surgical method for IMSCT, as it combines a satisfactory EOR with reduced risk of tissue damage and excellent pain relief.",Anne Elisabeth Carolus;Kirsten Schmieder;Christopher Brenke

86,Herschel Wilde,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have not evaluated the impact of illness severity and postrupture procedures in the cost of care for intracranial aneurysms. We hypothesize that the severity of aneurysm rupture and the aggressiveness of postrupture interventions play a role in cost.


METHODS
The Value Driven Outcomes database was used to assess direct patient cost during the treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysm with clipping, coiling, and Pipeline flow diverters.


RESULTS
One hundred ninety-eight patients (mean age 52.8 ± 14.1 years; 40.0% male) underwent craniotomy (64.6%), coiling (26.7%), or flow diversion (8.6%). Coiling was 1.4× more expensive than clipping (p = .005) and flow diversion was 1.7× more expensive than clipping (p < .001). More severe illness as measured by American Society of Anesthesia, Hunt/Hess, and Fisher scales incurred higher costs than less severe illness (p < .05). Use of a lumbar drain protocol to reduce subarachnoid hemorrhage and use of an external ventricular drain to manage intracranial pressure were associated with reduced (p = .05) and increased (p < .001) total costs, respectively. Patients with severe vasospasm (p < .005), those that received shunts (p < .001), and those who had complications (p < .001) had higher costs. Multivariate analysis showed that procedure type, length of stay, number of angiograms, vasospasm severity, disposition, and year of treatment were independent predictors of cost.


CONCLUSIONS
These results show for the first time that disease and vasospasm severity and intensity of treatment directly impact the cost of care for patients with aneurysms in the USA.

87,Phabinly J Gabriel,"BACKGROUND
The ""double flap"" reconstruction technique, comprised of a simultaneous vascularized pedicled pericranial flap (PCF) and pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF), can be used to repair anterior skull base defects after a combined cranionasal or transbasal-endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been performed to remove malignant anterior skull base tumors. The use of two vascularized flaps may potentially decrease the incidence of post-radiation flap necrosis and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks after radiation therapy.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of a prospective skull base database on patients who underwent the double flap reconstruction technique after a combined transbasal-EEA approach. Data collected for each patient included demographics, method of tumor resection and repair, complications, tumor recurrence, and follow-up.


RESULTS
Nine patients who underwent a combined transbasal-EEA approach for resection of anterior skull base tumors with significant intracranial extension followed by reconstruction of the cranial base using the double flap technique. Four were men and five were women, with a mean age of 49 years (range, 15-68 years). There was no postoperative CSF leakage detected or complications of infection, meningitis, mucocele, or tension pneumocephalus after a mean follow-up of 35.7 months (range, 4.5-98 months). Seven of the nine patients underwent adjuvant radiation without flap necrosis. Local tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the patients at last follow-up; however, one patient developed distant brain metastasis.


CONCLUSION
The simultaneous PCF and NSF double flap reconstruction is an effective technique in preventing postoperative CSF leakage and post-radiation necrosis when repairing anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal-EEA approaches. This technique may be useful in patients anticipated to undergo postoperative radiation therapy.",Gurkirat Kohli;Wayne D Hsueh;Jean Anderson Eloy;James K Liu
88,Anjuna Reghunath,"Spinal dysraphism is an umbrella term describing herniation of meninges or neural elements through defective neural arch. They can be broadly categorized into open and closed types. MRI is the investigation of choice to study neural abnormalities and to assess the severity of hydrocephalus and Chiari malformation. Knowledge of the embryology of these disorders is valuable in correctly identifying the type of dysraphism. The aim of surgery is untethering and dural reconstruction. Accurate depiction of the abnormal anatomy in cases of spinal dysraphism is of utmost importance for surgical management of these patients. MRI makes this possible due to its excellent soft tissue contrast resolution and multiplanar capability, allowing the radiologist to evaluate the intricate details in small pediatric spinal structures. Imaging enlightens the surgeons about the status of spinal cord and other associated abnormalities and helps detect re-tethering in operated cases. Besides, antenatal surgery to repair myelomeningoceles has made detection of open dysraphisms on fetal MRI and antenatal ultrasound critical. The purpose of this review is to describe the development of spine, illustrate the myriad imaging features of open and closed spinal dysraphisms, and enlist the reporting points the operating surgeon seeks from the radiologist.",Rohini Gupta Ghasi;Ankita Aggarwal
89,Michael George Zaki Ghali,"Sphenoid wing dural AVFs represent a rare clinical entity. These lesions may be asymptomatic or present with focal neurologic deficits, intracranial venous hypertension, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and diagnostic imaging. They are alternatively classified as lesions of either the greater or lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. We performed a search of the PubMed database of studies evaluating the clinical behavior and surgical and endovascular therapies of these lesions. Dural AVFs draining into the superficial middle cerebral vein and/or laterocavernous sinus, or rather, lesions of the greater wing of the sphenoid, exhibit a greater likelihood of developing an aggressive clinical course, with higher probability of cortical venous reflux and consequent intracranial venous hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, and symptomatic presentation. Dural AVFs of the sphenoparietal sinus, that is, lesions of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, typically exhibit a more benign clinical course, as there is a prominent epidural venous drainage into the cavernous sinus, reducing the risk of cortical venous reflux, and consequently, the probability of intracranial venous hypertension, hemorrhage, and floridly symptomatic presentation. These lesions may be treated via surgical clipping of the fistulous point, transarterial or transvenous embolization, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. Though surgical intervention was the principal therapy due to facility of craniotomy access to the fistulous point, embolization has become standard of care permitted by innovation in endovascular technology.

Patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) typically show progressive muscle weakness, respiratory dysfunction and minor cardiac involvement. Characteristics and modalities of motor and respiratory rehabilitation in LOPD are not well defined and specific guidelines are lacking. Therefore, we evaluated the role of physical activity, therapeutic exercise, and pulmonary rehabilitation programs in order to promote an appropriate management of motor and respiratory dysfunctions and improve QoL in patients with LOPD. We propose two operational protocols: one for an adapted physical activity (APA) plan and the other for an individual rehabilitation plan, particularly focused on therapeutic exercise (TE) and respiratory rehabilitation.",Michele Vitacca;Elena Carraro;Carmelo Chisari;Pietro Fiore;Sonia Messina;Tiziana Mongini;Antimo Moretti;Valeria A Sansone;Antonio Toscano;Gabriele Siciliano;
91,Kimberly L Ray,"Higher cognitive functioning is supported by adaptive reconfiguration of large-scale functional brain networks. Cognitive control (CC), which plays a vital role in flexibly guiding cognition and behavior in accordance with our goals, supports a range of executive functions via distributed brain networks. These networks process information dynamically and can be represented as functional connectivity changes between network elements. Using graph theory, we explored context-dependent network reorganization in 56 healthy adults performing fMRI tasks from two cognitive domains that varied in CC and episodic-memory demands. We examined whole-brain modular structure during the DPX task, which engages proactive CC in the frontal-parietal cognitive-control network (FPN), and the RiSE task, which manipulates CC demands at encoding and retrieval during episodic-memory processing, and engages FPN, the medial-temporal lobe and other memory-related networks in a context dependent manner. Analyses revealed different levels of network integration and segregation. Modularity analyses revealed greater brain-wide integration across tasks in high CC conditions compared to low CC conditions. Greater network reorganization occurred in the RiSE memory task, which is thought to require coordination across multiple brain networks, than in the DPX cognitive-control task. Finally, FPN, ventral attention, and visual systems showed within network connectivity effects of cognitive control; however, these cognitive systems displayed varying levels of network reorganization. These findings provide insight into how brain networks reorganize to support differing task contexts, suggesting that the FPN flexibly segregates during focused proactive control and integrates to support control in other domains such as episodic memory.",J Daniel Ragland;Angus W MacDonald;James M Gold;Steven M Silverstein;Deanna M Barch;Cameron S Carter
92,Senay Yildiz Celik,"Late-onset myasthenia gravis (LOMG) is a unique MG subgroup. More information is needed on its subgroups such as non-thymomatous generalized LOMG. We evaluated the effect of demographic, clinical, and serological factors as well as different immunosuppressive modalities on outcome in generalized non-thymomatous LOMG with onset ≥ 50 years. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification, MGFA postintervention score (MGFA PIS) and MG Composite scores were obtained to define the severity of disease and clinical outcome. In 95 patients with generalized non-thymomatous LOMG, 60 (63%) were men, 45 (47%) had mild disease, 80 (84%) were anti-AChR, and 56 (61%) were anti-titin positive. In those who received immunosuppressives and provided the clinical scores (84 patients), 50 (60%) had favorable outcome (MGFA PIS categories of complete stable remission, pharmacological remission and minimal manifestations) at the end of 3 years. Use of prednisone + azathioprine had significantly positive effect on outcome. The presence of anti-titin antibodies had no significant effect on severity and outcome. Five anti-MuSK-positive patients had favorable outcome. In conclusion, the presence of neither anti-titin nor anti-MuSK antibodies points to unfavorable outcome. Prednisone and azathioprine combination has beneficial effects in non-thymomatous generalized LOMG.",Hacer Durmus;Vuslat Yilmaz;Guher Saruhan Direskeneli;Yesim Gulsen Parman;Piraye Serdaroglu Oflazer;Feza Deymeer
93,Andrew H Dolinko,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of blindness for individuals under the age of 65. This loss of vision can be due to ischemia, neovascularization, and/or diabetic macular edema, which are caused by breakdown of the blood-retina barrier at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and inner retinal vasculature. The prevalence of diabetes and its complications differ between Caucasian-Americans and certain minority populations, such as African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Individuals can be classified by their mitochondrial haplogroups, which are collections of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) representing ancient geographic origins of populations. In this study, we compared the responses of diabetic human RPE cybrids, cell lines containing identical nuclei but mitochondria from either European (maternal European) or maternal African or Asian individuals, to hypoxia and high glucose levels. The African and Asian diabetic ([Afr+Asi]/DM) cybrids showed (1) resistance to both hyperglycemic and hypoxic stresses; (2) downregulation of pro-apoptotic indicator BAX; (3) upregulation of DNA methylation genes, such as DNMT3A and DNMT3B; and (4) resistance to DNA demethylation by the methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) compared to European diabetic (Euro/DM) cybrids. Our findings suggest that mitochondria from African and Asian diabetic subjects possess a ""metabolic memory"" that confers resistance against hyperglycemia, hypoxia, and demethylation, and that this ""metabolic memory"" can be transferred into the RPE cybrid cell lines in vitro.",Marilyn Chwa;Shari R Atilano;M Cristina Kenney
94,Abdel G Elkahloun,"Preclinical experiments and clinical trials demonstrated that angiotensin II AT1 receptor overactivity associates with aging and cellular senescence and that AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) protect from age-related brain disorders. In a primary neuronal culture submitted to glutamate excitotoxicity, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed expression of several hundred genes altered by glutamate and normalized by candesartan correlated with changes in expression in Alzheimer's patient's hippocampus. To further establish whether our data correlated with gene expression alterations associated with aging and senescence, we compared our global transcriptional data with additional published datasets, including alterations in gene expression in the neocortex and cerebellum of old mice, human frontal cortex after age of 40, gene alterations in the Werner syndrome, rodent caloric restriction, Ras and oncogene-induced senescence in fibroblasts, and to tissues besides the brain such as the muscle and kidney. The most significant and enriched pathways associated with aging and senescence were positively correlated with alterations in gene expression in glutamate-injured neurons and, conversely, negatively correlated when the injured neurons were treated with candesartan. Our results involve multiple genes and pathways, including CAV1, CCND1, CDKN1A, CHEK1, ICAM1, IL-1B, IL-6, MAPK14, PTGS2, SERPINE1, and TP53, encoding proteins associated with aging and senescence hallmarks, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cell cycle and mitochondrial function alterations, insulin resistance, genomic instability including telomere shortening and DNA damage, and the senescent-associated secretory phenotype. Our results demonstrate that AT1 receptor blockade ameliorates central mechanisms of aging and senescence. Using ARBs for prevention and treatment of age-related disorders has important translational value.",Juan M Saavedra
95,Jayantee Kalita,"The pattern of copper (Cu) toxicity in humans is similar to Wilson disease, and they have movement disorders and frequent involvement of corpus striatum. The extent of cell deaths in corpus striatum may be the basis of movement disorder and may be confirmed in the experimental study. To evaluate the extent of apoptosis and glial activation in corpus striatum following Cu toxicity in a rat model, and correlate these with spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), six male Wistar rats were fed normal saline (group I) and another six were fed copper sulfate 100 mg/kgBWt/daily orally (group II). At 1 month, neurobehavioral studies including SLA, rotarod, and grip strength were done. Corpus striatum was removed and was subjected to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. The concentration of tissue Cu, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutamate were measured. Group II rats had higher expression of caspase-3 (Mean ± SEM 32.67 ± 1.46 vs 4.47 ± 1.08; p < 0.01) and GFAP (41.81 ± 1.68 vs 31.82 ± 1.27; p < 0.01) compared with group I. Neurobehavioral studies revealed reduced total distance traveled, time moving, the number of rearing, latency to fall on the rotarod, grip strength, and increased resting time compared with group I. The expression of GFAP and caspase-3 correlated with SLA parameters, tissue Cu, GSH, MDA, TAC, and glutamate levels. The impaired locomotor activity in Cu toxicity rats is due to apoptotic and inflammatory-mediated cell death in the corpus striatum because of Cu-mediated oxidative stress and excitotoxicity.",Vijay Kumar;Usha K Misra;Himangsu K Bora
96,Xu Liu,"Polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with ischemic stroke occurrence and traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. However, few studies have examined recurrent ischemic stroke as an outcome. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine association of miRNA gene polymorphisms (namely, miR-126 rs4636297, miR-149 rs2292832, miR-124 rs531564, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-143 rs12655723, and miR-122 rs17669) with recurrence of ischemic stroke. miRNA gene polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method in 657 patients with ischemic stroke. Association of miRNA polymorphisms with prognosis outcomes was examined by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models. miR-122 rs17669 was significantly associated with recurrence risk of ischemic stroke under the recessive model. Cox regression analysis showed that the CC genotype of rs17669 was associated with an increased risk of 1.9-fold for stroke recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.879; 95% confidence interval = 1.182-2.985; P = 0.008). Further, this effect was more evident among the non-drinker and male subgroups. We found no difference in risk of recurrent ischemic stroke among the other five miRNA polymorphisms. Furthermore, we identified a significant association between the miR-149 rs2292832 polymorphism and age at onset of first-ever stroke. Altogether, miR-122 rs17669 is a significant predictor for the risk of recurrent stroke, independent of traditional risk factors.",Qianwen Wang;Ruixia Zhu

This model exhibits pathophysiological features similar to those reported in patients with PD, namely, striatal nitrosative and oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neural cytoarchitecture alteration. (-)Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and potent green tea catechin, has notable anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential protective effects of EGCG on ROT-induced motor and neurochemical dysfunctions in rats. Furthermore, we also aimed to study the neuroprotective mechanisms underlying these effects. ROT treatment (0.5 mg/kg s.c., 21 days) reduced body weight and induced significant motor impairments as assessed using an open-field test, rotarod test, grip strength measurement, and beam-crossing task. EGCG treatment (100 or 300 mg/kg i.p., 60 min prior to ROT administration, 21 days) prevented most of the ROT-induced motor impairments. Moreover, EGCG treatment reduced ROT-induced nitric oxide (NO) level and lipid peroxidation (LPO) production; increased the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), ATPase, and ETC enzymes and the levels of catecholamines in the striatum; and reduced the levels of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic markers. These results demonstrate the possible neuroprotective effects of EGCG against ROT-induced motor impairments, including anti-oxidatory effect, prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction, prevention of neurochemical deficiency, anti-neuroinflammatory effect, and anti-apoptotic effect. This is the first report about the neuroprotective effect of EGCG against ROT-induced motor impairments, and the above evidence provides a potential clinically relevant role for EGCG in delaying or treating human PD.",Mao-Hsien Wang;Kuo-Chi Chang;Hung-Sheng Soung;Chih-Hsiang Fang;Yi-Wen Lin;Keng-Yuan Li;Chih-Chuan Yang;Cheng-Chia Tsai
99,Pasquale Picone,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread form of dementia, characterized by memory loss and reduction of cognitive functions that strongly interfere with normal daily life. Numerous evidences show that aggregates of the amyloid beta peptide, formed by 39 to 42 amino acid residues (Aβ39-43), from soluble small oligomers to large fibrils are characteristic markers of this pathology. However, AD is a complex disease and its neurodegenerative molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood. Growing evidence suggests a link between Aβ polymorphic nature, oligomers and fibrils, and specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration. The Aβ variable nature and its multiplicity of interactions with different proteins and organelles reflect the complexity of this pathology. In this review, we analyze the effects of the interaction between Aβ peptide and different cellular compartments in relation to the different kinds and sizes of amyloid aggregates. In particular, Aβ interaction with different cell structures such as the plasma membrane, mitochondria, lysosomes, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum is discussed. Further, we analyze the Aβ peptide ability to modify the structure and function of the target organelle, inducing alteration of its physiological role thus contributing to the pathological event. Dysfunction of cellular components terminating with the activation of the cellular death mechanism and subsequent neurodegeneration is also taken into consideration.",Domenico Nuzzo;Daniela Giacomazza;Marta Di Carlo
100,Zhara Hakimi,"Inflammation can cause memory impairment. In the present study, the effect of carvacrol on brain tissue inflammation and oxidative stress as well as learning and memory in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged rats was evaluated. The animals were grouped and treated: (1) control which received vehicle instead of LPS and carvacrol, (2) LPS (1 mg/kg; i.p. 120 min before behavioral tests), and (3-5) in these groups, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of carvacrol (i.p.) was administered 30 min prior to LPS. In a Morris water maze test, compared to LPS group, administration of all three doses of carvacrol shortened the elapsed time and the traveled distance to find the platform, while it prolonged the traveled time in the target area. In a passive avoidance test, administration of all 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg carvacrol significantly increased the latency at the 3 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the shock compared to the LPS group. Interleukin (IL)-6, malondialdehyde (MDA), and NO (nitric oxide) metabolites were increased in the brain by LPS injection, while thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were decreased. Pretreatment with carvacrol reduced IL-6, NO metabolites, and MDA, while it improved thiol content, CAT, and SOD. The results indicated that carvacrol protected from learning and memory impairment and the brain tissue inflammation and oxidative stress in LPS-challenged rats.",Hossein Salmani;Narges Marefati;Zohre Arab;Zahra Gholamnezhad;Farimah Beheshti;Mohammad Naser Shafei;Mahmoud Hosseini
101,Amany Emam,"The teleost Astyanax mexicanus is one species extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish, they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and two independently adapted of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Müller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa. This article is protected by copyright.

102,Antonia Stefanov,"Rod-cone degenerations e.g. Retinitis Pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness worldwide. Despite slow disease progression in humans, vision loss is inevitable, therefore development of vision restoration strategies is crucial. Among others, promising approaches include optogenetics and prosthetic implants, which aim to bypass lost photoreceptors. Naturally, the efficacy of these therapeutic strategies will depend on inner retinal structural and functional preservation. The present study shows that in photo inducible I307N rhodopsin mice (Tvrm4) a 12 k lux light exposure eliminates photoreceptors in the central retina in 1 week, but interneurons and their synapses are maintained for as long as 9 weeks post-induction. Despite bipolar cell dendritic retraction and moderate loss of horizontal cells, the survival rate of various cell types is very high. Significant preservation of conventional synapses and gap junctions in the inner plexiform layer is also observed. We found the number of synaptic ribbons to gradually decline and their ultrastructure to become transiently abnormal, although based on our findings intrinsic retinal architecture is maintained despite complete loss of photoreceptors. Unlike common rodent models of photoreceptor degeneration, where the disease phenotype often interferes with retinal development, in Tvrm4 mice the degenerative process can be induced after retinal development is complete. This time course more closely mimics the timing of disease onset in affected patients. Stability of the inner retina found in these mutants 2 months after photoreceptor degeneration suggests moderate, stereotyped remodeling in the early stages of the human disease and represents a promising finding for prompt approaches of vision restoration.

103,Vittoria Pagliarini,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by loss of function mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and reduced expression of the SMN protein, leading to spinal motor neuron death, muscle weakness and atrophy. Although humans harbour the highly homologous SMN2 gene, its defective splicing regulation yields a truncated and unstable SMN protein. The first therapy for SMA was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and consists of an antisense oligonucleotide (Nusinersen) rendering SMN2 functional and thus improving patients' motor activity and quality of life. Nevertheless, not all patients equally respond to this therapy and the long-term tolerability and safety of Nusinersen are still unknown. Herein, in vivo splicing assays indicated that the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 is particularly efficient in rescuing the SMN2 splicing defect in SMA fibroblasts and SMA type-I mice-derived neural stem cells. Western blot analyses showed that LBH589 also causes a significant increase in SMN protein expression in SMA cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that LBH589 treatment induces widespread H4 acetylation of the entire SMN2 locus and selectively favour the inclusion of the disease-linked exon 7 in SMN2 mature mRNA. The combined treatment of SMA cells with sub-optimal doses of LBH589 and of an antisense oligonucleotide that mimic Nusinersen (ASO_ISSN1) elicits additive effects on SMN2 splicing and SMN protein expression. These findings suggest that HDAC inhibitors can potentiate the activity of Nusinersen and support the notion that ""SMN-plus"" combinatorial therapeutic approaches might represent an enhanced opportunity in the scenario of SMA therapy.",Marika Guerra;Valentina Di Rosa;Claudia Compagnucci;Claudio Sette
104,R S Duman,"The pathophysiology and treatment of depression has been the focus of intense research and while there is much that remains unknown, modern neurobiological approaches are making progress. This work demonstrates that stress and depression are associated with atrophy of neurons and reduced synaptic connectivity in brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that contribute to depressive behaviors, and conversely that antidepressant treatment can reverse these deficits. The role of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been of particular interest as these factors play a key role in activity dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity. Here we review the literature demonstrating that exposure to stress and depression decreases BDNF expression in the hippocampus and PFC and conversely that antidepressant treatment can up-regulate BDNF in the adult brain and reverse the effects of stress. We then focus on rapid acting antidepressants, particularly the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which produces rapid synaptic and antidepressant behavioral actions that are dependent on activity dependent release of BDNF. This rapid release of BDNF differs from typical monoaminergic agents that require chronic administration to produce a slow induction of BDNF expression, consistent with the time lag for the therapeutic action of these agents. We review evidence that other classes of rapid acting agents also require BDNF release, demonstrating that this is a common, convergent downstream mechanism. Finally, we discuss evidence that the actions of ketamine are also dependent on another growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its complex interplay with BDNF.",S Deyama;M V Fogaça

106,Helena Marcelino,"Brain adenosine concentrations can reach micromolar concentrations in stressful situations such as stroke, neurodegenerative diseases or hypoxic regions of brain tumours. Adenosine can act by receptor-independent mechanism by reversing the reaction catalysed by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, leading to SAH accumulation and inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases. Astrocytes are essential in maintaining brain homeostasis but their pathological activation and uncontrolled proliferation plays a role in neurodegeneration and glioma. Adenosine can affect cell proliferation, but the effect of increased adenosine concentration on proliferation of astrocytes is not clarified and was addressed in present work. Human astrocytes (HA) were treated for 3 days with test drugs. Cell proliferation/viability was assessed by the MTT assay and by cell counting. Cell death was evaluated by assessing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and by western blot analysis of αII-Spectrin cleavage. 30µM-Adenosine caused a 40%±3% (p < .05, n = 5) reduction in cell proliferation/viability, an effect reversed by 2U/ml-adenosine deaminase, but unchanged in the presence of antagonists of any of the adenosine receptors. Adenosine alone did not induce cell death. 100µM-Homocysteine alone caused 16%±3% (p < .05) decrease in HA proliferation. Combined action of adenosine and homocysteine decreased HA proliferation by 76%±4%, an effect higher (p < .05) than the sum of the effect of adenosine and homocysteine alone (56%±5%). The inhibitory effect of adenosine on HA proliferation/viability was mimicked by two adenosine kinase inhibitors and attenuated in the presence of folate (100µM) or SAM (50-100µM). The results suggest that adenosine reduces HA proliferation by a receptor-independent mechanism probably involving reversal of SAH hydrolase-catalysed reaction.",Vanda C Nogueira;Cecília R A Santos;Patrícia Quelhas;Tiago M A Carvalho;João Fonseca-Gomes;Joana Tomás;Maria J Diógenes;Ana M Sebastião;José F Cascalheira
107,Bertrand Bryche,"The olfactory mucosa, where the first step of odor detection occurs, is a privileged pathway for environmental toxicants and pathogens towards the central nervous system. Indeed, some pathogens can infect olfactory sensory neurons including their axons projecting to the olfactory bulb allowing them to bypass the blood-brain barrier and reach the central nervous system (CNS) through the so-called olfactory pathway. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major respiratory tract pathogen but there is growing evidence that RSV may lead to CNS impairments. However, the mechanisms involved in RSV entering into the CNS have been poorly described. In this study, we wanted to explore the capacity of RSV to reach the CNS via the olfactory pathway and to better characterize RSV cellular tropism in the nasal cavity. We first explored the distribution of RSV infectious sites in the nasal cavity by in vivo bioluminescence imaging and a tissue clearing protocol combined with deep-tissue imaging and 3D image analyses. This whole tissue characterization was confirmed with immunohistochemistry and molecular biology approaches.

108,Travis E Conley,"Studies have reported associations between environmental manganese (Mn) exposure and impaired cognition, attention, impulse control, and fine motor function in children. Our recent rodent studies established that elevated Mn exposure causes these impairments. Here, rats were exposed orally to 0, 25, or 50 mg Mn/kg/day during early postnatal life (PND 1-21) or lifelong to determine whether early life Mn exposure causes heightened behavioral reactivity in the open field, lasting changes in the catecholaminergic systems in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), altered dendritic spine density, and whether lifelong exposure exacerbates these effects. We also assessed astrocyte reactivity (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), and astrocyte complement C3 and S100A10 protein levels as markers of A1 proinflammatory or A2 anti-inflammatory reactive astrocytes. Postnatal Mn exposure caused heightened behavioral reactivity during the first 5 - 10 min intervals of daily open field test sessions, consistent with impairments in arousal regulation. Mn exposure reduced the evoked release of norepinephrine (NE) and caused decreased protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine (DA) and NE transporters, and DA D1 receptors, along with increased DA D2 receptors. Mn also caused a lasting increase in reactive astrocytes (GFAP) exhibiting increased A1 and A2 phenotypes, with a greater induction of the A1 proinflammatory phenotype. These results demonstrate that early life Mn exposure causes broad lasting hypofunctioning of the mPFC catecholaminergic systems, consistent with the impaired arousal regulation, attention, impulse control, and fine motor function reported in these animals, suggesting that mPFC catecholaminergic dysfunction may underlie similar impairments reported in Mn-exposed children.",Stephane A Beaudin;Stephen M Lasley;Casimir A Fornal;Jasenia Hartman;Walter Uribe;Tooba Khan;Barbara J Strupp;Donald R Smith
109,Louis Jacob,"BACKGROUND
Little is known about the long-term association between transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze the long-term risk of stroke and associated predictors in a large cohort of TIA patients followed in general practices in Germany.


METHODS
This study included patients with an initial TIA diagnosis and subsequently followed up in one of 1,262 general practices in Germany between January 2007 and December 2016 (N=19,824 patients). The primary outcome of the study was the risk of ischemic stroke within 10 years of the initial diagnosis of TIA. The secondary outcome was the identification of demographic, clinical, and pharmaceutical variables significantly associated with stroke in TIA patients.


RESULTS
Within 10 years of the initial TIA diagnosis, 18.3% of individuals were diagnosed with stroke. Age was positively associated with stroke, with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 1.88 in patients aged 51-60 years to 4.00 in those aged >80 years (reference group: patients aged ≤50 years). Furthermore, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart diseases had an additional impact on the risk of stroke. Finally, new oral anticoagulants, heparins, diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and platelet aggregation inhibitors were identified as protective factors.


CONCLUSIONS
In a cohort of almost 20,000 TIA patients, 18.3% were diagnosed with stroke within 10 years after the TIA index event. Several demographic, clinical, and pharmaceutical variables significantly predicted the long-term risk of stroke in TIA patients.",Christian Tanislav;Karel Kostev
110,Tomasz Grzegorski,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating, not fully understood disease of the central nervous system. The first demyelinating clinical episode is called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS. Although the most common manifestations of CIS are long tracts dysfunction and unilateral optic neuritis, it can also include isolated brainstem syndromes, cerebellar involvement, and polysymptomatic clinical image. Recently, the frequency of CIS diagnosis has decreased due to the more sensitive and less specific 2017 McDonald criteria compared with the revisions from 2010. Not all patients with CIS develop MS. The risk of conversion can be estimated based on many predictive factors including epidemiological, ethnical, clinical, biochemical, radiological, immunogenetic, and other markers. The management of CIS is nowadays widely discussed among clinicians and neuroscientists. To date, interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, cladribine, and some other agents have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies relying on large groups of patients with the first demyelinating event. All of these drugs were shown to have beneficial effects in patients with CIS and might be used routinely in the future. The goal of this article is to explore the most relevant topics regarding CIS as well as to provide the most recent information in the field. The review presents CIS definition, classification, clinical image, predictive factors, and management. What is more, this is one of very few reviews summarizing the topic in the light of the 2017 McDonald criteria.",Jacek Losy

112,Bethany A Freel,"Discerning the underlying pathological mechanisms and the identification of therapeutic strategies to treat individuals affected with rare neurological diseases has proven challenging due to a host of factors. For instance, rare diseases affecting the nervous system are inherently lacking in appropriate patient sample availability compared to more common diseases, while animal models often do not accurately recapitulate specific disease phenotypes. These challenges impede research that may otherwise illuminate aspects of disease initiation and progression, leading to the ultimate identification of potential therapeutics. The establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a human cellular model with defined genetics has provided the unique opportunity to study rare diseases within a controlled environment. iPSC models enable researchers to define mutational effects on specific cell types and signaling pathways within increasingly complex systems. Among rare diseases, pediatric diseases affecting neurodevelopment and neurological function highlight the critical need for iPSC-based disease modeling due to the inherent difficulty associated with collecting human neural tissue and the complexity of the mammalian nervous system. Rare neurodevelopmental disorders are therefore ideal candidates for utilization of iPSC-based in vitro studies. In this review, we address both the state of the iPSC field in the context of their utility and limitations for neurodevelopmental studies, as well as speculating about the future applications and unmet uses for iPSCs in rare diseases.",Jordan N Sheets;Kevin R Francis
113,V P Nikitin,"According to a common perspective, amnesia is a passive consequence of memory consolidation or reconsolidation impairment. The results of our own study, as well as literature data, allowed us to offer an interpretation of amnesia. Amnesia is an active process whose key characteristics are similar to those of other long-term plastic rearrangements of the brain, including learning processes. In accordance with this hypothesis, the review considers the data we obtained on the mechanisms of amnesia induction and development caused by impairment of conditioned food aversion memory consolidation or reconsolidation. In particular, experimental data indicating the dependence of amnesia induction on protein and RNA syntheses are described. After amnesia induction, a time-dependent reorganization of its processes is shown to occur. In early amnesia stages (< 10 days), a gradual decrease in the possibility of memory formation during a second training was observed. In late stages of amnesia (10 days or more), an unusual physiological phenomenon was revealed-the second training did not lead to the formation of long-term memory. This effect was specific, as memory for a new type of food could possibly be formed in these animals. The described properties of amnesia facilitate its characterization as specific anterograde amnesia. In addition, at an early but not late amnesia stages, reminder presentation caused amnesia reactivation, impairment of which by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors caused memory recovery. The results obtained allow us to characterize amnesia as a specific, time-dependent, separate process. In conclusion, the potential biological significance of the described type of amnesia is considered, and we discuss the possible molecular mechanisms underlying it.",S V Solntseva;S A Kozyrev;P V Nikitin
114,Maria Cotelli,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of language training, alone or in combination with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, designed to improve oral and written naming abilities in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), and to investigate whether gains can be maintained over time and generalize to untrained items. An electronic database search was conducted up to 31st of May 2019. Forty-three articles on language training alone and seven articles on the combined treatment fitted the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Results indicated that language training, alone or in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), improves oral naming accuracy for trained items in patients with PPA, with a long-term maintenance of the gain over time. Only language training combined with tDCS improves oral naming accuracy for untrained items. Considering written naming abilities, language training combined with tDCS improves performance for both trained and untrained items, immediately after training and at follow-up.",Rosa Manenti;Clarissa Ferrari;Elena Gobbi;Ambra Macis;Stefano F Cappa
115,John F Kihlstrom,"Four variants on Tulving's ""Remember/Know"" paradigm supported a tripartite classification of recollective experience in recognition memory into Remembering (as in conscious recollection of a past episode), Knowing (similar to retrieval from semantic memory), and Feeling (a priming-based judgment of familiarity). Recognition-by-knowing and recognition-by-feeling are differentiated by level of processing at the time of encoding (Experiments 1-3), shifts in the criterion for item recognition (Experiment 2), response latencies (Experiments 1-3), and changes in the response window (Experiment 3). False recognition is often accompanied by ""feeling"", but rarely by ""knowing""; d' is higher for knowing than for feeling (Experiments 1-4). Recognition-by-knowing increases with additional study trials, while recognition-by-feeling falls to zero (Experiment 4). In these ways, recognition-by-knowing is distinguished from recognition-by-feeling in much the same way as, in the traditional Remember/Know paradigm, recognition-by-remembering can be distinguished from recognition-without-remembering. Implications are discussed for dual-process theories of memory, and the search for the neural substrates of memory retrieval.",NA
116,Janet Metcalfe,"Many recent studies have shown that memory for correct answers is enhanced when an error is committed and then corrected, as compared to when the correct answer is provided without intervening error commission. The fact that the kind of errors that produced such a benefit, in past research, were those that were semantically related to the correct answer suggested that the effect may occur because the error provides a semantic stepping stone to the correct answer: the Semantic Mediation hypothesis. This hypothesis seems at odds with the finding that amnesics, including those studied by Tulving and his colleagues-who purportedly have spared semantic/implicit memory-experience enormous difficulties when they commit errors. Accordingly, the present experiments investigated whether the error-generation benefit seen in typicals was attributable Semantic Mediation or to Episodic Recollection. In Experiment 1, we used polysemous materials to create Congruent (e.g., wrist-palm) and Incongruent (e.g., tree-palm) cues for target words (e.g., HAND). In the Congruent condition, participants generated errors that were semantically related to the target (e.g., finger), and which could have provided a semantic mediator. In the Incongruent condition they generated errors that were unrelated to the target (e.g., coconut), and which, therefore, should not have provided a semantic mediator. The Congruent and Incongruent conditions both produced an error-generation benefit-contradicting the Semantic Mediation hypothesis. Experiment 2 showed that the error-generation benefit only occurred when the original error was also recollected on the final memory test. Indeed, in the Incongruent condition, when the error was not, itself, recalled, error generation resulted in a deficit in memory for the correct response. These results point to episodic/explicit, rather than semantic/implicit memory, as the locus of the 'learning from errors' benefits.",Barbie J Huelser
117,J Domínguez-Borràs,"It is debated whether the amygdala is critical for the emotional modulation of attention. While some studies show reduced attentional benefits for emotional stimuli in amygdala-damaged patients, others report preserved emotional effects. Various factors may account for these discrepant findings, including the temporal onset of the lesion, the completeness and severity of tissue damage, or the extent of neural plasticity and compensatory mechanisms, among others. Here, we investigated a rare patient with focal acute destruction of bilateral amygdala and adjacent hippocampal structures after late-onset herpetic encephalitis in adulthood. We compared her performance in two classic visual attention paradigms with that of healthy controls. First, we tested for any emotional advantage during an attentional blink task. Whereas controls showed better report of fearful and happy than neutral faces on trials with short lags between targets, the patient showed no emotional advantage, but also globally reduced report rates for all faces. Second, to ensure that memory disturbance due to hippocampal damage would not interfere with report performance, we also used a visual search task with either emotionally or visually salient face targets. Although the patient still exhibited efficient guided search for visually salient, non-emotional faces, her search slopes for emotional versus neutral faces showed no comparable benefit. In both tasks, however, changes in the patient predominated for happy more than fear stimuli, despite her normal explicit recognition of happy expressions. Our results provide new support for a causal role of the amygdala in emotional facilitation of visual attention, especially under conditions of increasing task-demands, and not limited to negative information. In addition, our data suggest that such deficits may not be amenable to plasticity and compensation, perhaps due to sudden and late-onset damage occurring in adulthood.",M Moyne;A Saj;R Guex;P Vuilleumier
118,Sheikh F Ahmad,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders that are associated with deficits in social interaction and communication. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG126 represents a promising therapeutic agent for several neuroinflammatory disorders. There are currently no treatments available that can improve ASD and we previously showed that AG126 treatment exerts beneficial effects on BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model for autism that shows the core features of ASD; however, the immunological mechanisms and molecular targets associated with this effect were previously unclear. This study was undertaken to delineate the neuroprotective effect of AG126 on BTBR mice. Here, using this mouse model, we investigated the effects of AG126 administration on IL-21R, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α, NOS2, STAT3, IL-27, and Foxp3 production by CD8+ T cells in the spleen by flow cytometry. We further explored the mRNA and protein expression of IL-21, IL-22, IL-1β, TNF-α, NOS2, JAK1, STAT3, IL-27, and Foxp3 in brain tissue by RT-PCR, and western blotting. We found that BTBR mice treated with AG126 exhibited significant decreases in IL-21R-, IL-21-, IL-22-, TNF-α-, NOS2-, STAT3-producing, and increases in IL-27- and Foxp3-producing, CD8+ T cells. Our results further demonstrated that AG126 treatment effectively decreased IL-21, IL-22, IL-1β, TNF-α, NOS2, JAK1, and STAT3, and increased IL-27 and Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression in brain tissues. Our findings suggest that AG126 elicits a neuroprotective response through downregulation of the IL-21/IL-21R and JAK/STAT pathway in BTBR mice, which could represent a promising novel therapeutic target for ASD treatment.",Mushtaq A Ansari;Ahmed Nadeem;Saleh A Bakheet;Sary Alsanea;Khaled A Al-Hosaini;Hafiz M Mahmood;Mohammad Z Alzahrani;Sabry M Attia
119,Suren B Bandara,"Previous studies demonstrated that pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) antagonist, elicits seizure-like phenotypes in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Here, we determined whether the GABAAR antagonists, tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) and picrotoxin (PTX), both listed as credible chemical threat agents, similarly trigger seizures in zebrafish larvae. Larvae of three, routinely used laboratory zebrafish lines, Tropical 5D, NHGRI and Tupfel long fin, were exposed to varying concentrations of PTZ (used as a positive control), PTX or TETS for 20 min at 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Acute exposure to PTZ, PTX or TETS triggered seizure behavior in the absence of morbidity or mortality. While the concentration-effect relationship for seizure behavior was similar across zebrafish lines for each GABAAR antagonist, significantly less TETS was required to trigger seizures relative to PTX or PTZ. Recordings of extracellular field potentials in the optic tectum of 5 dpf Tropical 5D zebrafish confirmed that all three GABAAR antagonists elicited extracellular spiking patterns consistent with seizure activity, although the pattern varied between chemicals. Post-exposure treatment with the GABAAR positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), diazepam, midazolam or allopregnanolone, attenuated seizure behavior and activity but did not completely normalize electrical field recordings in the optic tectum. These data are consistent with observations of seizure responses in mammalian models exposed to these same GABAAR antagonists and PAMs, further validating larval zebrafish as a higher throughput-screening platform for antiseizure therapeutics, and demonstrating its appropriateness for identifying improved countermeasures for TETS and other convulsant chemical threat agents that trigger seizures via GABAAR antagonism.",Dennis R Carty;Vikrant Singh;Danielle J Harvey;Natalia Vasylieva;Brandon Pressly;Heike Wulff;Pamela J Lein
120,Rania M Salama,"The complexity of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis is attributed to multiple pathways involved in the neurodegeneration process. Among these pathways arise the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis, where inhibition of this cascade has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Crocin, a carotenoid found in saffron, has shown beneficial effects against neurodegenerative diseases via anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. However, the exact molecular pathways involved in crocin's neuroprotective effects have not been fully elucidated. This drove our attention to unravel the possible involvement of PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway in the neuroprotective effect of crocin against rotenone (ROT)-induced PD in rats. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, crocin (30 mg/kg/day; i.p.), ROT (1.5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and ROT pre-treated with crocin for 30 days. Crocin administration showed a substantial behavioral improvement. At the cellular level, crocin significantly stimulated the PI3K/Akt pathway, augmented phospho-proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (p-PRAS40), mTOR and p-p70S6K levels. Consequently, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), forkhead box transcription factor of the O class (FoxO3a), and the downstream caspase-9 were decreased; thus, attenuating neurodegeneration, which was witnessed through increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine (DA), and hampered α-synuclein levels. Moreover, crocin showed enhanced expression of microRNA-7 (miRNA-7) and miRNA-221, which contributed to Akt/mTOR activation. These results were verified by improved histopathological portrait and increased number of intact neurons. In conclusion, crocin showed promising neuroprotective effects in ROT-induced PD via activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis and enhanced miRNA-7 and miRNA-221.",Ghada A Abdel-Latif;Samah S Abbas;Hekmat M El Magdoub;Mona F Schaalan
121,Odile Poirel,"Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) mediate the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. VGLUTs are pivotal actors of excitatory transmission and of almost all brain functions. Their implication in various pathologies has been clearly documented. Despite their functional importance, the pharmacology of VGLUTs is limited to a few dyes such as Trypan Blue, Rose Bengal or Brilliant Yellow type. Here, we report the design and evaluation of new potent analogs based on Trypan Blue scaffold. Our best compound, named LSP5-2157, has an EC50 of 50 nM on glutamate vesicular uptake. Using a 3D homology model of VGLUT1 and docking experiments, we determined its putative binding subdomains within vesicular glutamate transporters and validated the structural requirement for VGLUT inhibition. To better estimate the specificity and potency of LSP5-2157, we also investigated its ability to block glutamatergic transmission in autaptic hippocampal cells. Neither glutamate receptors nor GABAergic transmission or transmission machinery were affected by LSP5-2157. Low doses of compound reversibly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampal autpases. LSP5-2157 had a low and depressing effect on synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slice. Furthermore, LSP5-2157 had no effect on NMDA-R- mediated fEPSP but reduce synaptic plasticity induced by 3 trains of 100 Hz. Finally, LSP5-2157 had the capacity to inhibit VGLUT3-dependent auditory synaptic transmission in the guinea pig cochlea. In this model, it abolished the compound action potential of auditory nerve at high concentration showing the limited permeation of LSP5-2157 in an in-vivo model. In summary, the new ligand LSP5-2157, has a high affinity and specificity for VGLUTs and shows some permeability in isolated neuron, tissue preparations or in vivo in the auditory system. These findings broaden the field of VGLUTs inhibitors and open the way to their use to assess glutamatergic functions in vitro and in vivo.",Lauren E Mamer;Melissa A Herman;Marie Arnulf-Kempcke;Myriam Kervern;Brigitte Potier;Stephanie Miot;Jing Wang;Franck-Cyril Favre-Besse;Isabelle Brabet;Younès Laras;Hugues-Olivier Bertrand;Francine Acher;Jean-Philippe Pin;Jean-Luc Puel;Bruno Giros;Jacques Epelbaum;Christian Rosenmund;Patrick Dutar;Stephanie Daumas;Salah El Mestikawy;Nicolas Pietrancosta
122,Paola Alberti,"Oxaliplatin (OHP) Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity (OIPN) is one of the dose-limiting toxicities of the drug and these adverse effects limit cancer therapy with L-OHP, used for colorectal cancer treatment. Acute neurotoxicity consists of symptoms that are the hallmarks of a transient axonal hyperexcitability; chronic neurotoxicity has a clinical picture compatible with a length-dependent sensory neuropathy. Acute OIPN pathogenesis has been linked to sodium voltage-operated channels (Na + VOC) dysfunction and it has been advocated as a possible predisposing factor to chronic neurotoxicity. We tested if topiramate (TPM), a well-known Na + VOC modulator, was able to modify acute as well as chronic OIPN. The project was divided into two parts. In Experiment 1 we tested by means of Nerve Excitability Testing (NET) a cohort of female Wistar rats to assess TPM effects after a single OHP administration (5 mg/kg, iv). In Experiment 2 we assessed TPM effects after chronic OHP treatment (5 mg/kg, 2qw4ws, iv) using NET, nerve conduction studies (NCS), behavioral tests and neuropathology (caudal nerve morphometry and morphology and Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber [IENF] density). In Experiment 1 TPM was able to prevent OHP effects on Na + VOC: OHP treatment induced a highly significant reduction of the sensory nerve's threshold, during the superexcitability period (p-value = 0.008), whereas TPM co-administration prevented this effect. In Experiment 2 we verified that TPM was able to prevent not only acute phenomena, but also to completely prevent chronic OIPN. This latter observation was supported by a multimodal approach: in fact, only OHP group showed altered findings compared to CTRL group at a neurophysiological (proximal caudal nerve sensory nerve action potential [SNAP] amplitude, p-value = 0.001; distal caudal nerve SNAP amplitude, p-value<0.001, distal caudal nerve sensory conduction velocity, p-value = 0.04), behavioral (mechanical threshold, p-value 0.003) and neuropathological levels (caudal nerve fibers density, p-value 0.001; IENF density, p-value <0.001). Our data show that TPM is a promising drug to prevent both acute and chronic OIPN. These findings have a high translational potential, since they were obtained using outcome measures that match clinical practice and TPM is already approved for clinical use being free from detrimental interaction with OHP anticancer properties.",Annalisa Canta;Alessia Chiorazzi;Giulia Fumagalli;Cristina Meregalli;Laura Monza;Eleonora Pozzi;Elisa Ballarini;Virginia Rodriguez-Menendez;Norberto Oggioni;Giulio Sancini;Paola Marmiroli;Guido Cavaletti
123,R D Moreno-Fernández,"The LPA1 receptor, one of the six characterized G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1-6) through which lysophosphatidic acid acts, is likely involved in promoting normal emotional behaviours. Current data suggest that the LPA-LPA1-receptor pathway may be involved in mediating the negative consequences of stress on hippocampal function. However, to date, there is no available information regarding the mechanisms whereby the LPA1 receptor mediates this adaptation. To gain further insight into how the LPA-LPA1 pathway may prevent the negative consequences of chronic stress, we assessed the effects of the continuous delivery of LPA on depressive-like behaviours induced by a chronic restraint stress protocol. Because a proper excitatory/inhibitory balance seems to be key for controlling the stress response system, the gene expression of molecular markers of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission was also determined. In addition, the hippocampal expression of mineralocorticoid receptor genes and glucocorticoid receptor genes and proteins as well as plasma corticosterone levels were determined. Contrary to our expectations, the continuous delivery of LPA in chronically stressed animals potentiated rather than inhibited some (e.g., anhedonia, reduced latency to the first immobility period), though not all, behavioural effects of stress. Furthermore, this treatment led to an alteration in the genes coding for proteins involved in the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the ventral hippocampus and to changes in corticosterone levels. In conclusion, the results of this study reinforce the assumption that LPA is involved in emotional regulation, mainly through the LPA1 receptor, and regulates the effects of stress on hippocampal gene expression and hippocampus-dependent behaviour.",C Rosell-Valle;A Bacq;O Zanoletti;M Cifuentes;M Pérez-Martín;A L Gavito;M I García-Fernández;G Estivill-Torrús;F Rodríguez de Fonseca;L J Santín;C Sandi;C Pedraza
124,Mieke van Holstein,"Maladaptive decision making is a characteristic feature of substance use disorder and pathological gambling. Studies in humans and animals have implicated neural circuits that include the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in facilitating risk/reward decision making. However, the preclinical literature has focussed primarily on situations where animals use internally-generated information to adapt to changes in reward likelihood, whereas many real-life situations require the use of external stimuli to facilitate context-appropriate behavior. We recently developed the ""Blackjack"" task, to measure cued risk/reward decision making requiring rats to chose between Small/Certain and Large/Risky rewards, with auditory cues at the start of each trial explicitly informing that the probability of obtaining a large reward was either good (50%) or poor (12.5%). Here we investigated the contribution of the BLA and its interaction with the NAc in guiding these types of decisions. In well-trained male rats, bilateral inactivation of the BLA induced suboptimal decision making, primarily by reducing risky choice on good-odds trials. In comparison, pharmacological disconnection of the BLA and NAc-shell also induced suboptimal decision making, diverting choice from more preferred option by reducing or increasing risky choice on good vs. poor odds trials respectively. Together, these results suggest that the BLA-NAc circuitry plays a crucial role in integrating information provided by discriminative stimuli. Furthermore, this circuitry may aid in guiding action selection of advantageous options in situations to maximize rewards. Finally, they suggest that perturbations in optimal decision making observed in substance abuse and gambling disorders may be driven in part by dysfunction within this circuitry.",Paula E MacLeod;Stan B Floresco
125,Ruth Herbst,"The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) is the key signaling molecule during the formation of a mature and functional neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Signal transduction events downstream of MuSK activation induce both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation, which, most prominently, includes the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at synaptic sites. MuSK activation requires a complex interplay between its co-receptor Lrp4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-4), the motor neuron-derived heparan-sulfate proteoglycan Agrin and the intracellular adaptor protein Dok-7. A tight regulation of MuSK kinase activity is crucial for proper NMJ development. Defects in MuSK signaling are the cause of muscle weakness as reported in congenital myasthenic syndromes and myasthenia gravis. This review focuses on recent structure-based analyses of MuSK, Agrin, Lrp4 and Dok-7 interactions and their function during MuSK activation. Conclusions about the regulation of the MuSK kinase that were derived from molecular structures will be highlighted. In addition, the role of MuSK during development and disease will be discussed.",NA
126,Caroline Guglielmetti,"Alterations in myelin integrity are involved in many neurological disorders and demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method to diagnose and monitor MS patients, clinically available MRI protocols show limited specificity for myelin detection, notably in cerebral grey matter areas. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI has shown great promise for direct imaging of lipids and myelin sheaths, and thus holds potential to improve lesion detection. In this study, we used a sequence combining magnetization transfer (MT) with UTE (""UTE-MT"", TE ​= ​76 ​μs) and with short TE (""STE-MT"", TE ​= ​3000 ​μs) to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in brain myelin content in the cuprizone mouse model for MS on a clinical 7 ​T scanner. During demyelination, UTE-MT ratio (UTE-MTR) and STE-MT ratio (STE-MTR) values were significantly decreased in most white matter and grey matter regions. However, only UTE-MTR detected cortical changes. After remyelination in subcortical and cortical areas, UTE-MTR values remained lower than baseline values, indicating that UTE-MT, but not STE-MT, imaging detected long-lasting changes following a demyelinating event. Next, we evaluated the potential correlations between imaging values and underlying histopathological markers. The strongest correlation was observed between UTE-MTR and percent coverage of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining (r2 ​= ​0.71). A significant, although lower, correlation was observed between STE-MTR and MBP (r2 ​= ​0.48), and no correlation was found between UTE-MTR or STE-MTR and gliosis immunostaining. Interestingly, correlations varied across brain substructures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that UTE-MTR values significantly correlate with myelin content as measured by histopathology, not only in white matter, but also in subcortical and cortical grey matter regions in the cuprizone mouse model for MS. Readily implemented on a clinical 7 ​T system, this approach thus holds great potential for detecting demyelinating/remyelinating events in both white and grey matter areas in humans. When applied to patients with neurological disorders, including MS patient populations, UTE-MT methods may improve the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of brain lesions, not only during disease progression but also in response to next generation remyelinating therapies.",Tanguy Boucneau;Peng Cao;Annemie Van der Linden;Peder E Z Larson;Myriam M Chaumeil

128,Dennis M Hedderich,"Premature birth bears an increased risk for aberrant brain development concerning its structure and function. Cortical complexity (CC) expresses the fractal dimension of the brain surface and changes during neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that CC is altered after premature birth and associated with long-term cognitive development. One-hundred-and-one very premature-born adults (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500 g) and 111 term-born adults were assessed by structural MRI and cognitive testing at 27 years of age. CC was measured based on MRI by vertex-wise estimation of fractal dimension. Cognitive performance was measured based on Griffiths-Mental-Development-Scale (at 20 months) and Wechsler-Adult-Intelligence-Scales (at 27 years). In premature-born adults, CC was decreased bilaterally in large lateral temporal and medial parietal clusters. Decreased CC was associated with lower gestational age and birth weight. Furthermore, decreased CC in the medial parietal cortices was linked with reduced full-scale IQ of premature-born adults and mediated the association between cognitive development at 20 months and IQ in adulthood. Results demonstrate that CC is reduced in very premature-born adults in temporoparietal cortices, mediating the impact of prematurity on impaired cognitive development.

129,Joana Carvalho,"The characterization of receptive field (RF) properties is fundamental to understanding the neural basis of sensory and cognitive behaviour. The combination of non-invasive imaging, such as fMRI, with biologically inspired neural modelling has enabled the estimation of population RFs directly in humans. However, current approaches require making numerous a priori assumptions, so these cannot reveal unpredicted properties, such as fragmented RFs or subpopulations. This is a critical limitation in studies on adaptation, pathology or reorganization. Here, we introduce micro-probing (MP), a technique for fine-grained and largely assumption free characterization of multiple pRFs within a voxel. It overcomes many limitations of current approaches by enabling detection of unexpected RF shapes, properties and subpopulations, by enhancing the spatial detail with which we analyze the data. MP is based on tiny, fixed-size, Gaussian models that efficiently sample the entire visual space and create fine-grained probe maps. Subsequently, we derived population receptive fields (pRFs) from these maps. We demonstrate the scope of our method through simulations and by mapping the visual fields of healthy participants and of a patient group with highly abnormal RFs due to a congenital pathway disorder. Without using specific stimuli or adapted models, MP mapped the bilateral pRFs characteristic of observers with albinism. In healthy observers, MP revealed that voxels may capture the activity of multiple subpopulations RFs that sample distinct regions of the visual field. Thus, MP provides a versatile framework to visualize, analyze and model, without restrictions, the diverse RFs of cortical subpopulations in health and disease.",Azzurra Invernizzi;Khazar Ahmadi;Michael B Hoffmann;Remco J Renken;Frans W Cornelissen

131,Fuat Arikan,"BACKGROUND
Since the introduction of endovascular treatment for cerebral aneurysms, hospitals in which subarachnoid hemorrhage is treated show different availability and/or preferences towards both treatment modalities.


OBJECTIVES
The main aim is to evaluate the clinical and angiographic results according to the hospital's treatment preferences applied.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted based on use of the subarachnoid hemorrhage database of the Vascular Pathology Group of the Spanish Neurosurgery Society. Centers were classified into three subtypes according to an index in the relationship between endovascular and surgical treatment as: Endovascular preference, high endovascular preference, and elevated surgical preference. The clinical results and angiographic results were evaluated among the three treatment strategies.


RESULTS
From November 2004 to December 2017, 4282 SAH patients were selected for the study: 630 (14.7%) patients from centers with surgical preference, 2766 (64.6%) from centers with endovascular preference, and 886 (20.7%) from centers with high endovascular preference. The surgical preference group obtained the best angiographic results associated with a greater complete exclusion (OR 1.359; 95%CI 1.025-1.801; p=0.033). The surgical preference subgroup obtained the best outcome at discharge (65.45%), followed by high endovascular preference (61.5%) and endovascular preference (57.8%) (OR 1.359; 95%CI 1.025-1.801; p=0.033).


CONCLUSIONS
In Spain, there is significant variability in aneurysm exclusion treatment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Surgical centers offer better results for both surgical and endovascular patients. A multidisciplinary approach and the maintenance of an elevated quality of surgical competence could be responsible for these results.",Nacho Errando;Alfonso Lagares;Darío Gándara;Andreu Gabarros;Pablo López-Ojeda;Javier Ibáñez;Marta Brell;Pedro A Gómez;Jose A Fernández-Alén;Jesús Morera;Angel Horcajadas;Vicente Vanaclocha;José L Llácer;Elena Baño-Ruiz;Jesús M Gonçalves-Estella;Ramon Torné;Jhon A Hoyos;Rosario Sarabia;Ignacio Arrese;Gregorio Rodríguez-Boto;Adolfo de la Lama;Jaime Domínguez;Rubén Martín-Láez;David Santamarta-Gómez;Pedro D Delgado-López;Luís Ley-Urzaiz;Olga Mateo;Begoña Iza;Javier Orduna-Martínez;Francisco de Asís Lorente-Muñoz;Fernando Muñoz Hernández;Jone Iglesias;J Vilalta
132,Andromachi Roussopoulou,"BACKROUND & PURPOSE
Perioperative neck hematoma (PNH) requiring re-intervention is an important complication after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). There are limited data regarding the potential risk factors associated with PNH. The aim of this prospective, multicenter study was to document the rate of PNH in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (sCAS) patients treated with CEA within the first 14 days of cerebrovascular symptom onset and to identify possible predictors of this complication.


METHODS
Patients with non-disabling (mRS ≤ 2) acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack due to sCAS (≥70%) underwent CEA at three stroke-centers during a seven-year period. PNH requiring surgical re-intervention or transfusion during a 30-day follow-up period was determined by the attending surgeon but was also confirmed by an independent neurologist.


RESULTS
A total of 280 patients with sCAS underwent CEA within 14 days of ictus. PNH occurred in 10 cases (3.6%; 95%CI: 1.4%-5.8%). Pretreatment with therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) and history of atrial fibrillation were more prevalent in patients with PNH (20% vs. 3.1%, p= 0.047 & 30% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.05 respectively). Elapsed time between symptom onset and carotid surgery, pretreatment with dual antiplatelets, intravenous thrombolysis or prophylactic anticoagulation were not related to PNH in univariable analyses. Pretreatment with TA was independently associated with higher likelihood of PNH [OR: 10.69, 95%CI (1.74-65.72), p = 0.011] in multivariate logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders.


CONCLUSION
PNH is uncommon in patients with sCAS that are operated during the first 14 days of ictus.

133,Dimitrios M Anestis,"BACKGROUND
The Full Outline of Un-Responsiveness Score (FOURs) is a scale for clinical assessment of consciousness that was introduced to overcome disadvantages of the widely accepted Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).


OBJECTIVE
To carry out a systematic review and critical analysis of the available literature on the clinical application of FOURs and perform a comparison to GCS, in terms of reliability and predictive value.


METHODS
Initial search retrieved a total of 147 papers. After applying strict inclusion criteria and further article selection to overcome data heterogeneity, a statistical comparison of inter-rater reliability, in-hospital mortality and long-term outcome prediction between the two scales in the adult and pediatric population was done.


RESULTS
Even though FOURs is more complicated than GCS, its application remains quite simple. Its reliability, validity and predictive value have been supported by an increasing number of studies, especially in critical care. A statistically significant difference (p = .034) in predicting in-hospital mortality in adults, in favor of FOURs when compared to GCS, was found. However, whether it poses a clinically significant advantage in detecting patients' deterioration and outcome prediction, compared to other scaling systems, remains unclear.


CONCLUSIONS
Further studies are needed to discern the FOURs' clinical usefulness, especially in patients in non-critical condition, with milder disorders of consciousness.",Parmenion P Tsitsopoulos;Christos A Tsonidis;Nikolaos Foroglou
134,Li Ling,"OBJECTIVE
To quantitatively analyze distribution characteristics of sweat gland nerve fibres (SGNF) in normal Chinese individuals for obtaining a reference for early diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Skin biopsy samples were collected from 192 normal Chinese individuals and divided into six, four and two groups according to anatomic sites, age and gender, respectively. SGNF morphology was observed and SGNF density (SGNFD) was determined.


RESULTS
There was a significant difference in SGNFD among different anatomic sites, age and gender. A degressive tendency was observed from proximal to distal anatomic sites. SGNFD was the lowest in subjects in the 21-40-year-old age group, but was the highest in subjects in the >61-year-old age group. Overall, SGNFD fluctuated with age. SGNFD in males was significantly higher than that in females.


CONCLUSIONS
Distribution characteristics of SGNF in normal individuals may serve as a reference for early diagnosis of nerve fibre damage.",Yongdan Liu;Yifei Sun;Yun Cai;Ye Jiang;Longjian Chen;Long He;Jinwei Xue

Memory is an important brain function, and is impaired with brain lesions. Resection of the lesion is one solution for that, but presurgical planning (PSP) is needed to guide the surgery for maximum removal of the lesion, as well as maximum preservation of the function. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the best approaches for such a purpose, but performing an fMRI study needs careful consideration of the factors which influence its results. Studies have shown that mental fatigue does have the potential to alter brain functions, and therefore this study aims to identify if mental fatigue should also be considered as a confounding factor when performing an fMRI study, particularly for clinical purposes.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Using 57 healthy young volunteers, face and word encoding tasks were performed, with half of the participants performing the memory tasks after a set of language tasks and half of them before that.


RESULTS
The results showed that mental fatigue led to increased activity in the bilateral thalamus and caudate in the face encoding task, and in the right thalamus, posterior cingulate and medial temporal lobe in word encoding. In addition, activation was declined with mental fatigue in the left lingual, precuneus, and posterior cingulate gyri in face encoding.


CONCLUSION
This study has shown the importance of the number and sequence of cognitive/mental tasks when performing an fMRI study, which could help to obtain more reliable fMRI maps in clinical applications. This finding is also important for performing research/cognitive studies using fMRI.",Razieh Alemi;Haleh Khoshkhouy Delshad;Mohammad Ali Oghabian
136,Yin Niu,"OBJECTIVE
To report the treatment and outcome of traumatic intracranial aneurysm (TICA) cases at the Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University in China.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
All patients diagnosed with TICA at our institution from January 1, 1977, to October 31, 2018, and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the study. Cases were reported separately for those diagnosed before 1998 and those after 1998.


RESULTS
A total of 25 patients were included in the study. Ten were diagnosed with TICA prior to 1998. Seven of these 10 patients were treated surgically with parent artery sacrificed, including aneurysmectomy, trapping, and bypass. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score for the 7 patients with surgical treatment was 3.1. Three of the 10 patients died of severe complications, including intracranial infection, delayed bleeding, and deadly injury. After 1998, 15 patients were diagnosed with TICA. Thirteen presented with head trauma and two with iatrogenic TICA following ventricle drainage or sphenoid ridge meningioma resection. Thirteen were treated with endovascular treatment, including coil alone, glue, coil-associated glue, stent alone, stent-assisted coil embolization, one with clipping, and one with conservative treatment. The 13 patients with endovascular treatment achieved a mean GOS score of 4.5. Among the 13 patients, one died from intracranial infection, one suffered recurrence, and one had intraoperative rupture.


CONCLUSION
Although the treatment of TICA has traditionally been surgical, endovascular treatment with different techniques, such as endovascular patch, provides a valuable alternative. Currently, the flow diverter is a popular embolization device and may represent another valid treatment option for TICA.",Sheng Zhou;Jun Tang;Hongping Miao;Gang Zhu;Zhi Chen
137,Elena Pavlidis,"OBJECTIVE
To develop a standardised scheme for assessing normal and abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) features of preterm infants. To assess the interobserver agreement of this assessment scheme.


METHODS
We created a standardised EEG assessment scheme for 6 different post-menstrual age (PMA) groups using 4 EEG categories. Two experts, not involved in the development of the scheme, evaluated this on 24 infants <32 weeks gestational age (GA) using random 2 hour EEG epochs. Where disagreements were found, the features were checked and modified. Finally, the two experts independently evaluated 2 hour EEG epochs from an additional 12 infants <37 weeks GA. The percentage of agreement was calculated as the ratio of agreements to the sum of agreements plus disagreements.


RESULTS
Good agreement in all patients and EEG feature category was obtained, with a median agreement between 80% and 100% over the 4 EEG assessment categories. No difference was found in agreement rates between the normal and abnormal features (p = 0.959).


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a standard EEG assessment scheme for preterm infants that shows good interobserver agreement.


SIGNIFICANCE

138,Robert J Barry,"OBJECTIVE
Global EEG alpha activity is negatively correlated with skin conductance level (SCL), supporting alpha as an inverse marker of arousal. Frequency Principal Components Analysis (f-PCA) of resting EEG amplitude spectra has demonstrated natural components in the alpha band of healthy persons. This is a preliminary exploration of whether such components differ with arousal, possibly underpinning the anomalous ADHD hypoarousal link to reduced alpha.


METHOD
Twenty-seven right-handed undergraduate students participated in three 2 minute blocks of resting eyes-open/closed EEG and SCL: EO1, EC, EO2. For each condition, mean EEG spectra were submitted to separate f-PCAs.


RESULTS
The inverse alpha/SCL relationship was confirmed for band amplitudes. EO had two alpha components; both correlated negatively with SCL. EC alpha contained four components, but only one had a substantial negative correlation with SCL; two had no relationship, suggesting natural alpha components with different non-arousal functionality in EC.


CONCLUSION
Some alpha components in both EC and EO reflect arousal, with other non-arousal components in EC. Our f-PCA approach offers insight into previously-noted alpha anomalies in disorders such as ADHD.


SIGNIFICANCE
This proof of concept demonstration in typical participants may provide the basis for a new research effort in clinical disorders involving atypical arousal patterns.",Frances M De Blasio;Jack S Fogarty;Adam R Clarke
139,Olga V Sysoeva,"OBJECTIVE
Systematically review the abnormalities in event related potential (ERP) recorded in Rett Syndrome (RTT) patients and animals in search of translational biomarkers of deficits related to the particular neurophysiological processes of known genetic origin (MECP2 mutations).


METHODS
Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge and BIORXIV were searched for the relevant articles according to PRISMA standards.


RESULTS
ERP components are generally delayed across all sensory modalities both in RTT patients and its animal model, while findings on ERPs amplitude strongly depend on stimulus properties and presentation rate. Studies on RTT animal models uncovered the abnormalities in the excitatory and inhibitory transmission as critical mechanisms underlying the ERPs changes, but showed that even similar ERP alterations in auditory and visual domains have a diverse neural basis. A range of novel approaches has been developed in animal studies bringing along the meaningful neurophysiological interpretation of ERP measures in RTT patients.


CONCLUSIONS
While there is a clear evidence for sensory ERPs abnormalities in RTT, to further advance the field there is a need in a large-scale ERP studies with the functionally-relevant experimental paradigms.


SIGNIFICANCE
The review provides insights into domain-specific neural basis of the ERP abnormalities and promotes clinical application of the ERP measures as the non-invasive functional biomarkers of RTT pathophysiology.",Kirill Smirnov;Tatiana A Stroganova
140,Chad A Purnell,"OBJECTIVE
Up to 10% of midline nasal dermoid cysts have intracranial extension. Previous techniques of excision include frontal and frontonasal craniotomies via a coronal approach, combined with a direct cutaneous excision of the dermoid cyst. While the coronal incision allows for wide visualization, it carries significant risks of transfusion, blood loss, and scarring. The authors present an alternative technique in which access is gained through a midline extension of the dermoid cyst excision that provides direct access for a keyhole frontal craniotomy.


METHODS
The authors utilize a nasal bone osteotomy, pericranial flap, and keyhole-type craniotomy performed through a nasal midline incision for the treatment of nasal dermoid cysts with intracranial extension. They performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with nasal dermoid cysts treated at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago from 2009 to 2017. Patient demographic data, operative data, and in- and outpatient complication data were collected.


RESULTS
In 10 patients with cyst extension near or into the intracranial cavity (7 with true intracranial extension), the nasal osteotomy technique was performed. The mean blood loss was 13 ml, with a 0% transfusion rate. The mean length of inpatient stay was 1 day. A durotomy was made and repaired as part of the dermoid cyst dissection in 3 patients. One patient underwent intraoperative placement of a lumbar drain. The mean operative time was 228 minutes. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, including the need for a reoperation. No patients had any long-term complications, and no patients have had dermoid cyst recurrence. The appearance of the scar was acceptable in all cases.


CONCLUSIONS
The midline approach to nasal dermoid cysts with intracranial extension is safe and results in limited blood loss, short operative times, and short lengths of inpatient hospital stay. This is a viable technique for the treatment of this challenging pathology.",Rachel Skladman;Tord D Alden;Julia F Corcoran;Jeffrey C Rastatter
141,Andrew M Heitzer,"OBJECTIVE
High survival rates have led to an increased emphasis on the functional outcomes of children diagnosed with low-grade glioma. Most outcomes research has focused on risks associated with radiotherapy, but less is known about neuropsychological risks for patients treated with surgery alone. Here, the authors sought to examine the neuropsychological trajectories of children diagnosed with a low-grade glioma and monitored up to 6 years postsurgery. Secondarily, they explored demographic and clinical predictors of neuropsychological performance.


METHODS
The neuropsychological functioning of 32 patients (median age at diagnosis 10.0 years) was prospectively assessed annually for up to 6 years after surgery (median days from surgery at baseline = 72). Tumor location was predominately supratentorial (65.6%). A combination of performance-based and parent-reported measures was used to assess intelligence, memory, executive functioning, and fine motor control in all patients.


RESULTS
Binomial tests at the postoperative baseline revealed that the proportion of children falling below the average range (< 16th percentile) was significantly higher than the rate expected among healthy peers on measures of verbal memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and fine motor control (p < 0.05). Even so, linear mixed models indicated that neuropsychological functioning at the postoperative baseline did not significantly change over time for up to 6 years after surgery across all domains. A larger tumor size was associated with a slower reaction time (p < 0.01). A supratentorial tumor location and history of seizures were associated with more parent-reported executive difficulties (p < 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
While radiotherapy is a known risk factor for neuropsychological deficits in pediatric brain tumor patients, findings in this study indicate that children treated for low-grade glioma with surgery alone (without radiotherapy or chemotherapy) remain susceptible to difficulties with memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning that persist over time. Over half of the children in the study sample required school support services to address neuropsychological weaknesses. Although low-grade glioma is often conceptualized as a benign tumor, children treated for this lesion require ongoing monitoring and intervention to address neuropsychological weaknesses resulting from the tumor itself as well as the surgery.",Kimberly Raghubar;M Douglas Ris;Charles G Minard;Marsha N Gragert;Heather H Stancel;Jessica Orobio;Judy Xue;William Whitehead;M Fatih Okcu;Murali Chintagumpala;Lisa S Kahalley
142,Kyle P O'Connor,"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is the most common surgical procedure utilized for degenerative diseases of the cervical spine. The authors present the case of a 64-year-old man who underwent an ACDF for degenerative changes causing cervical stenosis with myelopathy. The patient's symptoms consisted of pain and weakness of the bilateral upper extremities that slowly progressed over 1.5 years. During the procedure, the superior horn of the thyroid cartilage impeded proper retraction, preventing adequate visualization due to its prominent size. At this point, otorhinolaryngology was consulted, which allowed for safe resection of this portion of the thyroid cartilage while preserving nearby critical structures. With the frequent usage of this surgical approach for various etiologies, the importance of proper recognition and consultation is paramount.

143,Ignacio J Barrenechea,"Surgery of the cervical spine under conscious sedation has been rarely reported in the literature. The main indications are the lack of neurophysiological monitoring and surgery in patients with high cardiovascular risk. To date, no reports of awake C1-2 instrumentation have been published in the English-language literature. The authors present the case of a 76-year-old patient with multiple myeloma and severe cardiomyopathy associated with primary amyloidosis who experienced severe myelopathy from a C2 pseudotumor associated with an odontoid fracture. Due to his high cardiovascular risk, the patient underwent C1 decompression and C1-2 instrumentation and fusion via an awake technique. To accomplish this task, the authors performed multilayered muscular infiltration of local anesthetics and avoided manipulating the C2 root by anchoring C1 with a rod-claw system. The procedure did not last longer than that of general anesthetic approaches, and no complaints were reported by the patient during surgery, which he described as an overall ""good experience."" The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day and resumed his previous work 3 months later. Performing surgery under local anesthesia and conscious sedation reduces the risk of perioperative cardiovascular and respiratory complications in these high-risk patients by avoiding the use of drugs with cardiodepressant effects and endotracheal intubation.",Luis Márquez;Héctor P Rojas;Marco Nicola;Carlos Dumont
144,Jonathan Shapey,"OBJECTIVE
Automatic segmentation of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) from MRI could significantly improve clinical workflow and assist in patient management. Accurate tumor segmentation and volumetric measurements provide the best indicators to detect subtle VS growth, but current techniques are labor intensive and dedicated software is not readily available within the clinical setting. The authors aim to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework to be embedded in the clinical routine for automatic delineation and volumetry of VS.


METHODS
Imaging data (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted [ceT1] and high-resolution T2-weighted [hrT2] MR images) from all patients meeting the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria who had a single sporadic VS treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery were used to create a model. The authors developed a novel AI framework based on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) to exploit the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions encountered in standard clinical imaging protocols. They used a computational attention module to enable the CNN to focus on the small VS target and propose a supervision on the attention map for more accurate segmentation. The manually segmented target tumor volume (also tested for interobserver variability) was used as the ground truth for training and evaluation of the CNN. We quantitatively measured the Dice score, average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and relative volume error (RVE) of the automatic segmentation results in comparison to manual segmentations to assess the model's accuracy.


RESULTS
Imaging data from all eligible patients (n = 243) were randomly split into 3 nonoverlapping groups for training (n = 177), hyperparameter tuning (n = 20), and testing (n = 46). Dice, ASSD, and RVE scores were measured on the testing set for the respective input data types as follows: ceT1 93.43%, 0.203 mm, 6.96%; hrT2 88.25%, 0.416 mm, 9.77%; combined ceT1/hrT2 93.68%, 0.199 mm, 7.03%. Given a margin of 5% for the Dice score, the automated method was shown to achieve statistically equivalent performance in comparison to an annotator using ceT1 images alone (p = 4e-13) and combined ceT1/hrT2 images (p = 7e-18) as inputs.


CONCLUSIONS
The authors developed a robust AI framework for automatically delineating and calculating VS tumor volume and have achieved excellent results, equivalent to those achieved by an independent human annotator. This promising AI technology has the potential to improve the management of patients with VS and potentially other brain tumors.",Guotai Wang;Reuben Dorent;Alexis Dimitriadis;Wenqi Li;Ian Paddick;Neil Kitchen;Sotirios Bisdas;Shakeel R Saeed;Sebastien Ourselin;Robert Bradford;Tom Vercauteren
145,Shawyon Baygani,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study is to determine if the preoperative Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) score is predictive of short- and intermediate-term PedsQL outcomes following Chiari decompression surgery. The utility of preoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in predicting pain, opioid consumption, and long-term PROs has been demonstrated in adult spine surgery. To the best of the authors' knowledge, however, there is currently no widely accepted tool to predict short-, intermediate-, or long-term outcomes after pediatric Chiari decompression surgery.


METHODS
A prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone first-time decompression for symptomatic Chiari malformation were identified and grouped according to their preoperative PedsQL scores: mild disability (score 80-100), moderate disability (score 60-79), and severe disability (score < 60). PedsQL scores at the 6-week, 3-month, and/or 6-month follow-ups were collected. Preoperative PedsQL subgroups were tested for an association with demographic and perioperative characteristics using one-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Preoperative PedsQL subgroups were tested for an association with improvements in short- and intermediate-term PedsQL scores using one-way ANOVA and a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test controlling for statistically different demographic characteristics when appropriate.


RESULTS
A total of 87 patients were included in this analysis. According to their preoperative PedsQL scores, 28% of patients had mild disability, 40% had moderate disability, and 32% had severe disability. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of comorbidities (p = 0.009) and the presenting symptoms of headaches (p = 0.032) and myelopathy (p = 0.047) among the subgroups; however, in terms of other demographic or operative factors, there was no significant difference. Patients with greater preoperative disability demonstrated statistically significantly lower PedsQL scores at all postoperative time points, except in terms of the parent-reported PedsQL at 6 months after surgery (p = 0.195). Patients with severe disability demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvements (compared to preoperative scores) in PedsQL scores at all time points after surgery, except in terms of the 6-week and 6-month PROs and the 6-month parent-reported outcomes (p = 0.068, 0.483, and 0.076, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with severe disability, as assessed by the PedsQL, had lower absolute PedsQL scores at all time points after surgery but greater improvement in short- and intermediate-term PROs. The authors conclude that the PedsQL is an efficient and accurate tool that can quickly assess patient disability in the preoperative period and predict both short- and intermediate-term surgical outcomes.",Kristin Zieles;Andrew Jea
146,Kubilay Aydin,"OBJECTIVE
The endovascular treatment of complex bifurcation aneurysms possessing a neck that incorporates multiple side branches remains a surgical challenge. Double-stent-assisted coiling techniques, such as those with stents in an X and Y configuration, enable the endovascular treatment of wide-necked complex intracranial bifurcation aneurysms. However, the intraluminal struts at the intersection point in X- and Y-stents are not amenable to endothelialization, which may lead to thromboembolic complications. Stenting in the T configuration is a relatively new double-stent coiling technique. T-stenting differs from X- or Y-stenting in that there are no overlapping or intersecting stent segments. Promising short-term results of T-stent-assisted coiling were recently reported. However, the long-term results have not yet been demonstrated. This retrospective study investigated the long-term angiographic and clinical results in patients with wide-necked complex intracranial bifurcation aneurysms treated with T-stent-assisted coiling.


METHODS
A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with wide-necked complex intracranial bifurcation aneurysms treated with T-stent-assisted coiling at 4 institutions. The technical success and the initial and follow-up clinical and angiographic outcomes were assessed. Aneurysm filling status was assessed according to the Raymond classification. Periprocedural and delayed complications were reviewed. The neurological status of the patients was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).


RESULTS
One hundred two aneurysms in 102 patients (54 females), whose mean age was 57.9 ± 13.0 years, were included in the study. T-stenting was performed successfully in all patients. Immediate postprocedural angiography revealed complete occlusion in 83.3% of patients. Periprocedural complications developed in 13.7%, resulting in permanent morbidity in 1.9% and death in 1%. Eighty patients (78.4%) had at least one follow-up DSA examination performed at 6 months or later following the endovascular procedure. The mean duration of angiographic follow-up was 30.0 ± 16.3 months. The last follow-up examinations showed complete occlusion in 90.0% of patients. During the follow-up period, only 1 patient (1.3%) required retreatment. Delayed thromboembolic complications were observed in 4 patients (3.9%) without permanent morbidity. The mRS scores of all patients at the last clinical follow-up were between 0 and 2.


CONCLUSIONS
The short-term angiographic findings showed that T-stent-assisted coiling is a feasible and effective endovascular method to treat wide-necked complex bifurcation aneurysms. The long-term angiographic follow-up results suggest that T-stent-assisted coiling provides a durable treatment for wide-necked complex bifurcation aneurysms with favorable clinical outcomes, demonstrating the long-term safety of T-stent-assisted coiling.",Christian Paul Stracke;Mehmet Barburoglu;Elif Yamac;Mynzhylky Berdikhojayev;Serra Sencer;René Chapot

Clinical evidence on giant intracranial aneurysms (GIAs), intracranial aneurysms with a diameter of at least 25 mm, is limited. The authors aimed to investigate the natural history, case fatality, and treatment outcomes of ruptured and unruptured GIAs.


METHODS
In this international observational registry study, patients with a ruptured or unruptured GIA received conservative management (CM), surgical management (SM), or endovascular management (EM). The authors investigated rupture rates and case fatality.


RESULTS
The retrospective cohort comprised 219 patients with GIAs (21.9% ruptured GIAs and 78.1% unruptured GIAs) whose index hospitalization occurred between January 2006 and November 2016. The index hospitalization in the prospective cohort (362 patients with GIAs [17.1% ruptured and 82.9% unruptured]) occurred between December 2008 and February 2017. In the retrospective cohort, the risk ratio for death at a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (SD 2.2 years) after CM, compared with EM and SM, was 1.63 (95% CI 1.23-2.16) in ruptured GIAs and 3.96 (95% CI 2.57-6.11) in unruptured GIAs. In the prospective cohort, the 1-year case fatality in ruptured GIAs/unruptured GIAs was 100%/22.0% during CM, 36.0%/3.0% after SM, and 39.0%/12.0% after EM. Corresponding 1-year rupture rates in unruptured GIAs were 25.0% during CM, 1.2% after SM, and 2.5% after EM. In unruptured GIAs, the HR for death within the 1st year in patients with posterior circulation GIAs was 6.7 (95% CI 1.5-30.4, p < 0.01), with patients with a GIA at the supraclinoid internal carotid artery as reference. Different sizes of unruptured GIAs were not associated with 1-year case fatality.


CONCLUSIONS
Rupture rates for unruptured GIAs were high, and the natural history and treatment outcomes for ruptured GIAs were poor. Patients undergoing SM or EM showed lower case fatality and rupture rates than those undergoing CM. This difference in outcome may in part be influenced by patients in the CM group having been found poor candidates for SM or EM.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02066493 (clinicaltrials.gov).",Daniel Rüfenacht;Bernhard Meyer;Veit Rohde;Matthias Endres;Pavlina Lenga;Konstantin Uttinger;Viktoria Rücker;Maria Wostrack;Adisa Kursumovic;Bujung Hong;Dorothee Mielke;Nils Ole Schmidt;Jan-Karl Burkhardt;Philippe Bijlenga;Edoardo Boccardi;Christophe Cognard;Peter U Heuschmann;Peter Vajkoczy
148,Praveen V Mummaneni,"OBJECTIVE
Discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility or another acute-care facility not only constitutes a postoperative challenge for patients and their care team but also contributes significantly to healthcare costs. In this era of changing dynamics of healthcare payment models in which cost overruns are being increasingly shifted to surgeons and hospitals, it is important to better understand outcomes such as discharge disposition. In the current article, the authors sought to develop a predictive model for factors associated with nonroutine discharge after surgery for grade I spondylolisthesis.


METHODS
The authors queried the Quality Outcomes Database for patients with grade I lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis who underwent a surgical intervention between July 2014 and June 2016. Only those patients enrolled in a multisite study investigating the impact of fusion on clinical and patient-reported outcomes among patients with grade I spondylolisthesis were evaluated. Nonroutine discharge was defined as those who were discharged to a postacute or nonacute-care setting in the same hospital or transferred to another acute-care facility.


RESULTS
Of the 608 patients eligible for inclusion, 9.4% (n = 57) had a nonroutine discharge (8.7%, n = 53 discharged to inpatient postacute or nonacute care in the same hospital and 0.7%, n = 4 transferred to another acute-care facility). Compared to patients who were discharged to home, patients who had a nonroutine discharge were more likely to have diabetes (26.3%, n = 15 vs 15.7%, n = 86, p = 0.039); impaired ambulation (26.3%, n = 15 vs 10.2%, n = 56, p < 0.001); higher Oswestry Disability Index at baseline (51 [IQR 42-62.12] vs 46 [IQR 34.4-58], p = 0.014); lower EuroQol-5D scores (0.437 [IQR 0.308-0.708] vs 0.597 [IQR 0.358-0.708], p = 0.010); higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (3 or 4: 63.2%, n = 36 vs 36.7%, n = 201, p = 0.002); and longer length of stay (4 days [IQR 3-5] vs 2 days [IQR 1-3], p < 0.001); and were more likely to suffer a complication (14%, n = 8 vs 5.6%, n = 31, p = 0.014). On multivariable logistic regression, factors found to be independently associated with higher odds of nonroutine discharge included older age (interquartile OR 9.14, 95% CI 3.79-22.1, p < 0.001), higher body mass index (interquartile OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31-3.25, p < 0.001), presence of depression (OR 4.28, 95% CI 1.96-9.35, p < 0.001), fusion surgery compared with decompression alone (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p < 0.001), and any complication (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-10.9, p < 0.001).

149,Adham M Khalafallah,"OBJECTIVE
Previous authors have investigated many factors that predict an academic neurosurgical career over private practice, including attainment of a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and number of publications. Research has yet to demonstrate whether a master's degree predicts an academic neurosurgical career. This study quantifies the association between obtaining a Master of Science (MS), Master of Public Health (MPH), or Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree and pursuing a career in academic neurosurgery.


METHODS
Public data on neurosurgeons who had graduated from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited residency programs in the period from 1949 to 2019 were collected from residency and professional websites. Residency graduates with a PhD were excluded to isolate the effect of only having a master's degree. A position was considered ""academic"" if it was affiliated with a hospital that had a neurosurgery residency program; other positions were considered nonacademic. Bivariate analyses were performed with Fisher's exact test. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model.


RESULTS
Within our database of neurosurgery residency alumni, there were 47 (4.1%) who held an MS degree, 31 (2.7%) who held an MPH, and 10 (0.9%) who held an MBA. In bivariate analyses, neurosurgeons with MS degrees were significantly more likely to pursue academic careers (OR 2.65, p = 0.0014, 95% CI 1.40-5.20), whereas neurosurgeons with an MPH (OR 1.41, p = 0.36, 95% CI 0.64-3.08) or an MBA (OR 1.00, p = 1.00, 95% CI 0.21-4.26) were not. In the multivariate analysis, an MS degree was independently associated with an academic career (OR 2.48, p = 0.0079, 95% CI 1.28-4.93). Moreover, postresidency h indices of 1 (OR 1.44, p = 0.048, 95% CI 1.00-2.07), 2-3 (OR 2.76, p = 2.01 × 10-8, 95% CI 1.94-3.94), and ≥ 4 (OR 4.88, p < 2.00 × 10-16, 95% CI 3.43-6.99) were all significantly associated with increased odds of pursuing an academic career. Notably, having between 1 and 11 months of protected research time was significantly associated with decreased odds of pursuing academic neurosurgery (OR 0.46, p = 0.049, 95% CI 0.21-0.98).


CONCLUSIONS
Neurosurgery residency graduates with MS degrees are more likely to pursue academic neurosurgical careers relative to their non-MS counterparts. Such findings may be used to help predict residency graduates' future potential in academic neurosurgery.",Adrian E Jimenez;Rafael J Tamargo;Timothy Witham;Judy Huang;Henry Brem;Debraj Mukherjee
150,Daniel G Eichberg,"OBJECTIVE
In some centers where brain tumor surgery is performed, the opportunity for expert intraoperative neuropathology consultation is lacking. Consequently, surgeons may not have access to the highest quality diagnostic histological data to inform surgical decision-making. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is a novel technology that allows for rapid acquisition of diagnostic histological images at the bedside.


METHODS
The authors performed a prospective blinded cohort study of 82 consecutive patients undergoing resection of CNS tumors to compare diagnostic time and accuracy of SRH simulation to the gold standard, i.e., frozen and permanent section diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by concordance of SRH-simulated intraoperative pathology consultation with a blinded board-certified neuropathologist, with official frozen section and permanent section results.


RESULTS
Overall, the mean time to diagnosis was 30.5 ± 13.2 minutes faster (p < 0.0001) for SRH simulation than for frozen section, with similar diagnostic correlation: 91.5% (κ = 0.834, p < 0.0001) between SRH simulation and permanent section, and 91.5% between frozen and permanent section (κ = 0.894, p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
SRH-simulated intraoperative pathology consultation was significantly faster and equally accurate as frozen section.",Ashish H Shah;Long Di;Alexa M Semonche;George Jimsheleishvili;Evan M Luther;Christopher A Sarkiss;Allan D Levi;Sakir H Gultekin;Ricardo J Komotar;Michael E Ivan
151,William B Harris,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to perform an individual participant data meta-analysis to identify preoperative factors associated with a good seizure outcome in children with Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) undergoing resective or hemispheric epilepsy surgery.


METHODS
Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched with no language or date restrictions to identify cohort studies of consecutive participants undergoing resective surgery that reported seizure outcomes. The authors recorded all preoperative factors that could plausibly be associated with seizure outcomes and used Cox regression analysis to identify which of these variables were associated with seizure freedom (i.e., Engel class I).


RESULTS
Of 720 citations, 19 articles reporting on 187 participants were eligible. Seizure freedom (Engel class I) was observed in 113 participants (60.4%). On univariate analyses, younger age at disease onset (hazard ratio [HR] 0.906, p = 0.001), younger age at surgery (HR 0.928, p < 0.001), shorter time to surgery (HR 0.921, p = 0.001), and hemispherectomy (HR 0.283, p < 0.001) were all associated with longer time to postoperative seizure recurrence. Additionally, multivariable analysis including the aforementioned variables showed that younger age at surgery (HR 0.946, p = 0.043) and hemispherectomy (HR 0.297, p < 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with a greater time to seizure recurrence and longer duration of seizure freedom.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of pediatric patients undergoing resective or hemispheric surgery for RE achieve good seizure outcome. Although small retrospective cohort studies are inherently prone to bias, the best available evidence utilizing individual participant data suggests hemispheric surgery and younger age at surgery are associated with good seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. Large, multicenter observational studies with long-term follow-up are required to evaluate the risk factors identified in this review.",H Westley Phillips;Jia Shu Chen;Alexander G Weil;George M Ibrahim;Aria Fallah
152,Dana L Cruz,"OBJECTIVE
Neck and back pain are highly prevalent conditions that account for major disability. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) are the two most common functional status measures for neck and back pain. However, no single instrument exists to evaluate patients with concurrent neck and back pain. The recently developed Total Disability Index (TDI) combines overlapping elements from the ODI and NDI with the unique items from each. This study aimed to prospectively validate the TDI in patients with spinal deformity, back pain, and/or neck pain.


METHODS
This study is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single center. The 14-item TDI, derived from ODI and NDI domains, was administered to consecutive patients presenting to a spine practice. Patients were assessed using the ODI, NDI, and EQ-5D. Validation of internal consistency, test-retest reproducibility, and validity of reconstructed NDI and ODI scores derived from TDI were assessed.


RESULTS
A total of 252 patients (mean age 55 years, 56% female) completed initial assessments (back pain, n = 115; neck pain, n = 52; back and neck pain, n = 55; spinal deformity, n = 55; and no pain/deformity, n = 29). Of these patients, 155 completed retests within 14 days. Patients represented a wide range of disability (mean ODI score: 36.3 ± 21.6; NDI score: 30.8 ± 21.8; and TDI score: 34.1 ± 20.0). TDI demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.922) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). Differences between actual and reconstructed scores were not clinically significant. Subanalyses demonstrated TDI's ability to quantify the degree of disability due to back or neck pain in patients complaining of pain in both regions.


CONCLUSIONS
The TDI is a valid and reliable disability measure in patients with back and/or neck pain and can capture each spine region's contribution to total disability. The TDI could be a valuable method for total spine assessment in a clinical setting, and its completion is less time consuming than that for both the ODI and NDI.",Ethan W Ayres;Matthew A Spiegel;Louis M Day;Robert A Hart;Christopher P Ames;Douglas C Burton;Justin S Smith;Christopher I Shaffrey;Frank J Schwab;Thomas J Errico;Shay Bess;Virginie Lafage;Themistocles S Protopsaltis
153,Ignazio G Vetrano,"OBJECTIVE
Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) include mainly schwannomas-the most common tumors arising from peripheral nerves-and neurofibromas. Due to their origin, distinguishing between functional intact nerve and the fibers from whence the PNST arose may not always be easy to perform. The introduction of intraoperative tools to better visualize these tumors could be helpful in achieving a gross-total resection. In this study, the authors present a series of patients harboring PNST in which the surgery was performed under fluorescein guidance.


METHODS
Between September 2018 and February 2019, 20 consecutive patients with a total of 25 suspected PNSTs underwent fluorescein-guided surgery performed under microscopic view with a dedicated filter integrated into the surgical microscope (YELLOW 560) and with intraoperative monitoring. All patients presented with a different degree of contrast enhancement at preoperative MRI. Fluorescein was intravenously injected after intubation at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Preoperative clinical and radiological data, intraoperative fluorescein characteristics, and postoperative neurological and radiological outcomes were collected and analyzed.


RESULTS
Six patients were affected by neurofibromatosis or schwannomatosis. There were 14 schwannomas, 8 neurofibromas, 1 myxoma, 1 reactive follicular hyperplasia, and 1 giant cell tumor of tendon sheath. No patient experienced worsening of neurological status after surgery. No side effects related to fluorescein injection were found in this series. Fluorescein allowed an optimal intraoperative distinction between tumor and surrounding nerves in 13 of 14 schwannomas and in all neurofibromas. In 6 neurofibromas and in 1 schwannoma, the final YELLOW 560 visualization showed the presence of small tumor remnants that were not visible under white-light illumination and that could be removed, obtaining a gross-total resection.


CONCLUSIONS
Fluorescein was demonstrated to be a feasible, safe, and helpful intraoperative adjunct to better identify and distinguish PNSTs from intact functional nerves, with a possible impact on tumor resection, particularly in diffuse neurofibromas.",Francesco Acerbi;Jacopo Falco;Grazia Devigili;Sara Rinaldo;Giuseppe Messina;Francesco Prada;Antonio D'Ammando;Vittoria Nazzi
154,R Loch Macdonald,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to measure the concentration of nimodipine in CSF and plasma after intraventricular injection of a sustained-release formulation of nimodipine (EG-1962) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).


METHODS
Patients with SAH repaired by clip placement or coil embolization were randomized to EG-1962 or oral nimodipine. Patients were classified as grade 2-4 on the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale for SAH and had an external ventricular drain inserted as part of their standard of care. Cohorts of 12 patients received 100-1200 mg of EG-1962 as a single intraventricular injection (9 per cohort) or they remained on oral nimodipine (3 per cohort). Plasma and CSF were collected from each patient for measurement of nimodipine concentrations and calculation of maximum plasma and CSF concentration, area under the concentration-time curve from day 0 to 14, and steady-state concentration.


RESULTS
Fifty-four patients in North America were randomized to EG-1962 and 18 to oral nimodipine. Plasma concentrations increased with escalating doses of EG-1962, remained stable for 14 to 21 days, and were detectable at day 30. Plasma concentrations in the oral nimodipine group were more variable than for EG-1962 and were approximately equal to those occurring at the EG-1962 800-mg dose. CSF concentrations of nimodipine in the EG-1962 groups were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than in the oral nimodipine group, in which nimodipine was only detected at low concentrations in 10% (21/213) of samples. In the EG-1962 groups, CSF nimodipine concentrations were 1000 times higher than plasma concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
Plasma concentrations of nimodipine similar to those achieved with oral nimodipine and lasting for 21 days could be achieved after a single intraventricular injection of EG-1962. The CSF concentrations from EG-1962, however, were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than those with oral nimodipine. These results supported a phase 3 study that demonstrated a favorable safety profile for EG-1962 but yielded inconclusive efficacy results due to notable differences in clinical outcome based on baseline disease severity.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT01893190 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",Daniel Hänggi;Poul Strange;Hans Jakob Steiger;J Mocco;Michael Miller;Stephan A Mayer;Brian L Hoh;Herbert J Faleck;Nima Etminan;Michael N Diringer;Andrew P Carlson;Francois Aldrich;
155,Wenjing Zhang,"Abnormal neuroanatomic brain networks have been reported in schizophrenia, but their characterization across patients with psychotic disorders, and their potential alterations in nonpsychotic relatives, remain to be clarified. Participants recruited by the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes consortium included 326 probands with psychotic disorders (107 with schizophrenia (SZ), 87 with schizoaffective disorder (SAD), 132 with psychotic bipolar disorder (BD)), 315 of their nonpsychotic first-degree relatives and 202 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the participant groups. Compared with healthy controls, psychotic probands showed decreased nodal efficiency mainly in bilateral superior temporal regions. These regions had altered morphological relationships primarily with frontal lobe regions, and their network-level alterations were associated with positive symptoms of psychosis. Nonpsychotic relatives showed lower nodal centrality metrics in the prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions, and higher nodal centrality metrics in the left cingulate cortex and left thalamus. Diagnosis-specific analysis indicated that individuals with SZ had lower nodal efficiency in bilateral superior temporal regions than controls, probands with SAD only exhibited lower nodal efficiency in the left superior and middle temporal gyrus, and individuals with psychotic BD did not show significant differences from healthy controls. Our findings provide novel evidence of clinically relevant disruptions in the anatomic association of the superior temporal lobe with other regions of whole-brain networks in patients with psychotic disorders, but not in their unaffected relatives, suggesting that it is a disease-related trait. Network disorganization primarily involving frontal lobe and subcortical regions in nonpsychotic relatives may be related to familial illness risk.",Du Lei;Sarah K Keedy;Elena I Ivleva;Seenae Eum;Li Yao;Carol A Tamminga;Brett A Clementz;Matcheri S Keshavan;Godfrey D Pearlson;Elliot S Gershon;Jeffrey R Bishop;Qiyong Gong;Su Lui;John A Sweeney
156,Antony D Abraham,"Chronic pain affects a significant percentage of the United States population, and available pain medications like opioids have drawbacks that make long-term use untenable. Cannabinoids show promise in the management of pain, but long-term treatment of pain with cannabinoids has been challenging to implement in preclinical models. We developed a voluntary, gelatin oral self-administration paradigm that allowed male and female mice to consume ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or morphine ad libitum. Mice stably consumed these gelatins over 3 weeks, with detectable serum levels. Using a real-time gelatin measurement system, we observed that mice consumed gelatin throughout the light and dark cycles, with animals consuming less THC-gelatin than the other gelatin groups. Consumption of all three gelatins reduced measures of allodynia in a chronic, neuropathic sciatic nerve injury model, but tolerance to morphine developed after 1 week while THC or CBD reduced allodynia over three weeks. Hyperalgesia gradually developed after sciatic nerve injury, and by the last day of testing, THC significantly reduced hyperalgesia, with a trend effect of CBD, and no effect of morphine. Mouse vocalizations were recorded throughout the experiment, and mice showed a large increase in ultrasonic, broadband clicks after sciatic nerve injury, which was reversed by THC, CBD, and morphine. This study demonstrates that mice voluntarily consume both cannabinoids and opioids via gelatin, and that cannabinoids provide long-term relief of chronic pain states. In addition, ultrasonic clicks may objectively represent mouse pain status and could be integrated into future pain models.",Edward J Y Leung;Brenden A Wong;Zeena M G Rivera;Lauren C Kruse;Jeremy J Clark;Benjamin B Land
157,Vanda Faria,"Expectancies of nicotine content have been shown to impact smokers' subjective responses and smoking behaviors. However, little is known about the neural substrates modulated by verbally induced expectancies in smokers. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how verbally induced expectations, regarding the presence or absence of nicotine, modulated smokers' neural response to a nicotine-free odor. While laying in the scanner, all participants (N = 24) were given a nicotine-free odor, but whereas one group was correctly informed about the absence of nicotine (control group n = 12), the other group was led to believe that the presented odor contained nicotine (expectancy group n = 12). Smokers in the expectancy group had significantly increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during the presentation of the nicotine-free odor in the left ventral tegmental area (VTA), and in the right insula, as compared to smokers in the control group (Regions of interest analysis with pFWE-corrected p ≤ 0.05). At a more liberal uncorrected statistical level (p-unc ≤ 0.001), increased bilateral reactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was also observed in the expectancy group as compared with the control group. Our findings suggest that nicotine-expectancies induced through verbal instructions can modulate nicotine relevant brain regions, without nicotine administration, and provide further neural support for the key role that cognitive expectancies play in the cause and treatment of nicotine dependence.",Pengfei Han;Akshita Joshi;Paul Enck;Thomas Hummel
158,Mustafa Khalid,"Compared with the biological paradigms of classical conditioning, non-adaptive computational models are not capable of realistically simulating the biological behavioural functions of the hippocampal regions, because of their implausible requirement for a large number of learning trials, which can be on the order of hundreds. Additionally, these models did not attain a unified, final stable state even after hundreds of learning trials. Conversely, the output response has a different threshold for similar tasks in various models with prolonged transient response of unspecified status via the training or even testing phases. Accordingly, a green model is a combination of adaptive neuro-computational hippocampal and cortical models that is proposed by adaptively updating the whole weights in all layers for both intact networks and lesion networks using instar and outstar learning rules with adaptive resonance theory (ART). The green model sustains and expands the classical conditioning biological paradigms of the non-adaptive models. The model also overcomes the irregular output response behaviour by using the proposed feature of adaptivity. Further, the model successfully simulates the hippocampal regions without passing the final output response back to the whole network, which is considered to be biologically implausible. The results of the Green model showed a significant improvement confirmed by empirical studies of different tasks. In addition, the results indicated that the model outperforms the previously published models. All the obtained results successfully and quickly attained a stable, desired final state (with a unified concluding state of either ""1"" or ""0"") with a significantly shorter transient duration.",Jun Wu;Taghreed M Ali;Ahmed A Moustafa;Qiuguo Zhu;Rong Xiong
159,Qi Fang,"In the mammalian visual system, information from the retina streams into parallel bottom-up pathways. It remains unclear how these pathways interact to contribute to contextual modulation of visual cortical processing. By optogenetic inactivation and activation of mouse lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of thalamus, a homolog of pulvinar, or its projection to primary visual cortex (V1), we found that LP contributes to surround suppression of layer (L) 2/3 responses in V1 by driving L1 inhibitory neurons. This results in subtractive suppression of visual responses and an overall enhancement of orientation, direction, spatial, and size selectivity. Neurons in V1-projecting LP regions receive bottom-up input from the superior colliculus (SC) and respond preferably to non-patterned visual noise. The noise-dependent LP activity allows V1 to ""cancel"" noise effects and maintain its orientation selectivity under varying noise background. Thus, the retina-SC-LP-V1 pathway forms a differential circuit with the canonical retino-geniculate pathway to achieve context-dependent sharpening of visual representations.",Xiao-Lin Chou;Bo Peng;Wen Zhong;Li I Zhang;Huizhong Whit Tao
160,Yasaman Bagherzadeh,"Decreases in alpha synchronization are correlated with enhanced attention, whereas alpha increases are correlated with inattention. However, correlation is not causality, and synchronization may be a byproduct of attention rather than a cause. To test for a causal role of alpha synchrony in attention, we used MEG neurofeedback to train subjects to manipulate the ratio of alpha power over the left versus right parietal cortex. We found that a comparable alpha asymmetry developed over the visual cortex. The alpha training led to corresponding asymmetrical changes in visually evoked responses to probes presented in the two hemifields during training. Thus, reduced alpha was associated with enhanced sensory processing. Testing after training showed a persistent bias in attention in the expected directions. The results support the proposal that alpha synchrony plays a causal role in modulating attention and visual processing, and alpha training could be used for testing hypotheses about synchrony.",Daniel Baldauf;Dimitrios Pantazis;Robert Desimone
161,Yi-Rong Peng,"Many neuronal types occur as pairs that are similar in most respects but differ in a key feature. In some pairs of retinal neurons, called paramorphic, one member responds to increases and the other to decreases in luminance (ON and OFF responses). Here, we focused on one such pair, starburst amacrine cells (SACs), to explore how closely related neuronal types diversify. We find that ON and OFF SACs are transcriptionally distinct prior to their segregation, dendritic outgrowth, and synapse formation. The transcriptional repressor Fezf1 is selectively expressed by postmitotic ON SACs and promotes the ON fate and gene expression program while repressing the OFF fate and program. The atypical Rho GTPase Rnd3 is selectively expressed by OFF SACs and regulates their migration but is repressed by Fezf1 in ON SACs, enabling differential positioning of the two types. These results define a transcriptional program that controls diversification of a paramorphic pair.",Rebecca E James;Wenjun Yan;Jeremy N Kay;Alex L Kolodkin;Joshua R Sanes
162,Md Razib Hossain,"MDGA1 (MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor) has recently been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Dysregulation of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems has long been associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we measured prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response and ex vivo tissue content of monoamines and their metabolites in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus of Mdga1 homozygous (Mdga1-KO), Mdga1 heterozygous (Mdga1-HT) and wild-type (WT) male mice. We found that Mdga1-KO mice exhibited statistically significant impairment of PPI, and had higher levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) in all three brain regions studied compared with Mdga1-HT and WT mice (P < 0.05), while levels of norepinephrine, DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-methoxytyramine remained unchanged. Mdga1-KO mice also had a lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in the striatum (P < 0.05) compared with WT mice. 5-HT levels remained unchanged with the exception of a significant increase in the level in the cortex. These data are the first evidence suggesting that MDGA1 deficiency leads to a pronounced deficit in PPI and plays an important role in perturbation of DA and 5-HT metabolism in mouse brain; such changes may contribute to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Mostofa Jamal;Yu Tanoue;Daiki Ojima;Hiroo Takahashi;Takashi Kubota;Tuba M Ansary;Asuka Ito;Naoko Tanaka;Hiroshi Kinoshita;Yasushi Kishimoto;Tohru Yamamoto
163,Tuo Yang,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
A major gap in the field of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is whether or not long-lasting neuroprotection can be achieved. Moreover, the specific mechanisms underlying IPC and how they can be translated into the clinic remain uncertain. To fill these gaps, we tested the hypothesis that IPC exerts long-lasting structural and functional neuroprotection against ischemic stroke through the master gatekeeper of antioxidant defenses, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). We also tested whether the brain could be pharmaceutically preconditioned with a potent and blood-brain barrier-permeable Nrf2 activator, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-oleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-trifluoethyl amide (CDDO-TFEA).


METHODS
IPC was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 12 min, and ischemic stroke was generated by MCAO for 60 min in wild-type (WT) or Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice. Sensorimotor function, learning/memory skills, and brain tissue loss were measured up to 35 days after stroke. Primary rodent cortical neurons from wildtype (WT) and Nrf2 KO mice were subjected to lethal oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or a brief OGD episode as a preconditioning (PC) stimulus before OGD. Cell viability/death, lipid electrophile generation, and Nrf2 activation were measured. CDDO-TFEA or its vehicle was administered in vivo for three consecutive days before MCAO. Tissue loss and neurological tests were performed 35 days after stroke.


RESULTS
IPC significantly reduced sensorimotor deficits, post-stroke cognitive impairments, and brain tissue loss, 35 days after MCAO in WT mice. These enduring protective effects of IPC were inhibited in Nrf2 KO mice. In neuronal cultures, PC also endowed primary neurons with ischemic tolerance against OGD-induced cell death, an effect that was abolished by loss of Nrf2 expression in KO neurons. PC induced the generation of low levels of lipid electrophiles and led to activation of the Nrf2 pathway. The mechanism underlying IPC may be translatable, as exogenous administration of the Nrf2 activator CDDO-TFEA significantly reduced neurological dysfunction and ischemic brain damage after MCAO.


CONCLUSIONS
IPC provides long-lasting neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury and post-stroke cognitive dysfunction. Nrf2 activation plays a key role in this beneficial outcome and is a promising therapeutic target for the attenuation of ischemic brain injury.",Yang Sun;Qianqian Li;Senmiao Li;Yejie Shi;Rehana K Leak;Jun Chen;Feng Zhang

165,Chunhui Wu,"Clinical and preclinical researches have shown that sub-anesthetic ketamine elicits sustained antidepressant effects for up to 1-2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics studies (t1/2 = 23 min) in mice showed no ketamine residue at 24 h after sub-anesthetic or anesthetic ketamine administration. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the mechanism underlying these different biological functions at 24 h after sub-anesthetic and anesthetic ketamine treatment. First, at the animal behavioral level, we found that sub-anesthetic ketamine induced antidepressant and anxiolytic effects while anesthetic ketamine induced depressive-like phenotypes and cognitive impairment. Second, we examined the correlation between behavior phenotype and protein expression, and found that the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level is oppositely regulated by sub-anesthetic and anesthetic ketamine. Sub-anesthetic ketamine significantly increased the BDNF level, correlating to antidepressant effects; whereas anesthetic dose reduced BDNF expression in the hippocampus, correlating to depressive-like behaviors, anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. Third, the antidepressant effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine were prevented by pre-treatment of ANA-12, a Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) inhibitor. Thus, we conclude that BDNF may be the key factor underlying antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine at 24 h after treatment. These results may shed light on future studies and the development of long-lasting anti-depressant drugs and therapies.",Yu Wang;Yang He;Song Wu;Zhifei Xie;Jian Zhang;Jingshan Shen;Zhen Wang;Ling He
166,Jennifer D Ryan,"The value of case studies in informing our understanding of dissociations and interactions in memory was recognized early on by Endel Tulving, whose comprehensive work with the amnesic case K.C. helped to confirm distinctions between episodic and semantic memory. Following in this tradition, we examined memory and the use of cognitive strategies in the developmental amnesic case H.C., a young woman with structural abnormalities in the extended hippocampal system (Rosenbaum et al., 2014). H.C. was tested on two tasks, transitivity and transverse patterning, that each required learning the relations among items, and for the former, also examined the ability to make inferences across sets of relations. H.C. was tested across multiple sessions and demonstrated two seemingly contradictory patterns of performance: evidence of gradual learning, yet an inability to flexibly switch to a cognitive strategy that may otherwise benefit performance. Specifically, on the transitivity task, H.C. showed gradual learning of novel relations that led to successful inferential performance. On transverse patterning, H.C. showed some gradual learning of the relations among the objects across sessions, and expressed knowledge that the task followed 'rock-paper-scissors' rules. However, H.C. did not benefit from a unitization strategy, which had shown previous success with other amnesic cases (D'Angelo et al., 2015; Ryan, Moses, Barense, & Rosenbaum, 2013). H.C.'s over-reliance on 'rock-paper-scissors' rules, even in the face of alternate strategies, is suggestive of an inability to enact cognitive flexibility. Poor performance thus may have resulted from interference from the experimentally presented strategy on her self-imposed strategy. The present findings echo work reported by Tulving in case K.C. (Tulving, Hayman, & Macdonald, 1991). Whereas neurologically intact individuals may rely on the functions of the hippocampal system to rapidly learn new information and resolve interference, some individuals with hippocampal amnesia may learn information gradually, but such learning is particularly prone to interference, resulting in an inability to flexibly adapt to changes in the learning conditions in order to optimize performance.",Maria C D'Angelo;Arber Kacollja;Sandra Gardner;R Shayna Rosenbaum

168,Toru Nakamura,"Dopamine (DA) signaling in the basal ganglia plays important roles in motor control. Motor deficiencies were previously reported in dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) knockout mice. While these results indicate the involvement of DA receptors in motor execution, the null knockout (KO) mouse lacks the specificity necessary to determine when and where in the brain D1R and D2R function in motor execution. To address these questions, we restricted the loss of function temporally and spatially by using D1R conditional knockdown (cKD) mice and mice injected with antagonists against DA receptors directly into the dorsal striatum. In addition, we address the DA and acetylcholine (ACh) balance hypothesis by using antagonists against ACh receptors. We tested the motor ability of the mice with a newly devised task named the accelerating step-wheel. In this task, the maximum running speed was measured in a situation where the wheel rotation speed was gradually accelerated in one trial. We found significant decreases in the maximum running speed of D1R cKD mice and the mice injected with the antagonist against D1R or muscarinic ACh receptor.

169,Satoko Koganemaru,"Although specific brain regions are important for regularly patterned limb movements, the rhythm generation system that governs bipedal locomotion in humans is not thoroughly understood. We investigated whether rhythmic transcranial brain stimulation over the cerebellum could alter walking rhythm. Fourteen healthy subjects performed over-ground walking for 10 min during which they were given, in a random order, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left cerebellum at the approximated frequency of their gait cycle, tACS over the skin of the scalp, and during sham stimulation. Cerebellar tACS showed a significant entrainment of gait rhythm compared with the control conditions. When the direction of the tACS currents was symmetrically inverted, some subjects showed entrainment at an approximately 180° inverted phase, suggesting that gait modulation is dependent on current orientation. These findings indicate that tACS over cerebellum can modulate gait generation system in cerebellum and become an innovative approach for the recovery of locomotion in patients with gait disturbances caused by CNS disorders.",Yusuke Mikami;Masao Matsuhashi;Dennis Q Truong;Marom Bikson;Kenji Kansaku;Tatsuya Mima
170,Hongning Jia,"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is associated with high neonatal mortality and permanent neurologic deficit. Recent data suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) may have essential functions in the regulation of HIE. This study aims to investigate the functional role of miR-499-5p and the underlying mechanism in regulating neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain injury. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting assay were performed to investigate the relationship between miR-499-5p and C-reactive protein (CRP). TUNEL staining assay was applied to evaluate neuronal cell apoptosis in the hippocampus after administration of miR-499-5p in HIE rat model. Neurobehavioral assays were conducted to evaluate the effect of miR-499-5p on the neurological functions of rat pups with HI-induced brain injury. Our study showed that miR-499-5p regulated CRP expression in L-02 cells and rat HIE model. The miR-499-5p treatment resulted in significant reduction of neuronal cell apoptosis and the infarct size of the brain. Furthermore, administration of miR-499-5p significantly improved spatial learning ability, spatial memory, and locomotor function of rat pups with HIE. Our data demonstrated that miR-499-5p have a neuroprotective effect in HI-induced brain injury in rat pups, which suggests a potential therapeutic application of miR-499-5p in the treatment of neonatal HIE.",Mingwei Qu;Guimei Fan;Huijun Wu;Limin Wang
171,Yijie Zhao,"The neural mechanisms associated with the limited capacity of working memory (WM) has long been studied, but it is still unclear which neural regions are associated with the precision of visual WM. Here, an orientation recall task for estimating the trial-wise precision of visual WM was performed and then repeated two weeks later in an fMRI scanner. Results showed that activity in frontal and parietal regions during WM maintenance scaled with WM load, but not with the precision of WM (i.e., recall error in radians). Conversely, activity in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) during WM maintenance was not affected by memory load, but rather, correlated with WM precision on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, activity in LOC also correlated with the individual participant's precision of WM from a separate behavioral experiment. Interestingly, a region within the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), exhibited greater functional connectivity with LOC when the WM load increased. Together, our findings provide unique evidence that the LOC supports visual WM precision, while communication between the IFJ and LOC varies based on WM load demands. These results suggest an intriguing possibility that distinct neural mechanisms may be associated with general content (load) or detailed information (precision) of WM.",Shuguang Kuai;Theodore P Zanto;Yixuan Ku
172,Sabrini Sabrini,"Animal studies have consistently observed neuronal death following methamphetamine (MA) administration, however, these have not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review aims to present the evidence for MA-induced neuronal death in animals (rodents) and identify the regions affected. Locating the brain regions in which neuronal death occurs in animal studies will provide valuable insight into the linkage between MA consumption and the structural alterations observed in the human brain. The data were collected from three databases: Scopus, Ovid, and the Web of Science. Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two sub-groups, i.e. acute and repeated administration. Twenty-six (of 27) acute and ten (of 11) repeated administration studies observed neuronal death. A meta-analysis was not possible due to different variables between studies, i.e. species, treatment regimens, withdrawal periods, methods of quantification, and regions studied. Acute MA treatment induced neuronal death in the frontal cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra, but not in the hippocampus, whereas repeated MA administration led to neuronal loss in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum. In addition, when animals self-administered the drug, neuronal death was observed at much lower doses than the doses administered by experimenters. There is some overlap in the regions where neuronal death occurred in animals and the identified regions from human studies. For instance, gray matter deficits have been observed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of MA users. The findings presented in this review implicate that not only does MA induce neuronal death in animals, but it also damages the same regions affected in human users. Despite the inter-species differences, animal studies have contributed significantly to addiction research, and are still of great assistance for future research with a more relevant model of compulsive drug use in humans.",Russell Bruce;Y Wang Grace;C Lin Joanne;J Kirk Ian;E Curley Louise
173,Cheng Wang,"Evidence of structural abnormalities in the nervous system of recreational drug [e.g., phencyclidine (PCP) or ketamine] users and/or preclinical animal research models suggests interference with the activity of multiple neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate neurotransmission. The damage to the central nervous system (CNS) may include neuronal loss, synaptic changes, disturbed neural network formation and reduced projections to subcortical fields. Notably, the reduced projections may considerably compromise the establishment of the subcortical areas, such as the nucleus accumbens located in the basal forebrain. With its abundant dopaminergic innervation, the nucleus accumbens is believed to be directly associated with addictive behaviors and mental disorders. This review seeks to delineate the relationship between PCP/ketamine-induced loss of cortical neurons and the reduced level of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in the striatum, and the likely changes in striatal synaptogenesis during development. The basic mechanism of how PSA-NCAM cell surface expression may be regulated will also be discussed, as well as the hypothesis that PSA-NCAM activity is critical to the regulation of synaptic protein expression. Overall, the present review will address the general hypothesis that damage/interruption of cortico-striatal communication and subcortical synaptogenesis could underlie the erratic/sensitization or addictive states produced by chronic or prolonged PCP/ketamine usage.",Amy Inselman;Shuliang Liu;Fang Liu
174,Marta Barenys,"The increasing use of illegal drugs by pregnant women causes a public health concern because it is associated with health risks for mothers and their developing children. One of such drugs is MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or ecstasy due to its high consumption in relevant age and sex groups and its adverse effects on human and rodent developing brains. To thoroughly review the current knowledge on the developmentally neurotoxic potential of MDMA we systematically collected and summarized articles investigating developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) of MDMA in humans and animals in in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we summarized the findings in a putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP). From an initial 299 articles retrieved from the bibliographic databases Web of Science, PubMed and DART, we selected 39 articles according to inclusion/exclusion criteria for data collection after title/abstract and full text screening. Of these 3 where epidemiological studies, 34 where in vivo studies in mice and rats and 2 were in vitro studies. The three epidemiological studies reported from the same longitudinal study and suggested that MDMA exposure during pregnancy impairs neuromotor function in infants. In rat, postnatal exposure towards MDMA also caused locomotor deficits as well as impaired spatial learning that might be associated with decreased serotonin levels in the hippocampus. In vitro MDMA caused cytotoxicity at high concentrations and effects on the serotonergic and neuritogenic alterations at lower concentrations which are in line with some of the in vivo alterations observed. Considering the adverse outcomes of developmental MDMA described in humans and in rodents we summarized the first putative AOP on developmental compound exposure leading to impaired neuromotor function in children. For generation of this AOP, MDMA exposure was taken as a model compound. In addition, we hypothesized a second AOP involving developmental disturbance of the dopaminergic system. However, further in vitro mechanistic studies are needed to understand the molecular initiating event(s) (MIE) triggering the downstream cascades and obtain consistent evidences causally linking the adverse outcome to effects at the cellular, organ and organism level.",Ingrid Reverte;Stefan Masjosthusmann;Jesús Gómez-Catalán;Ellen Fritsche
175,Rudolf Černý,"OBJECTIVES
This study aimed to assess vestibular function in 39 patients who underwent neurectomy for vestibular schwannoma.


METHOD
Semicircular canal reactivity was measured by video head-impulse test using high-frequency passive head acceleration. Response gain was calculated as a ratio between the areas under the eye-velocity curve and the head-velocity curve.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Student t-test was used for to compare quantitative variables. ANOVA was used to test inter-group differences in categoric variables.


RESULTS
In all cases, surgery-side gain on head impulse test was low, with increased gain asymmetry. A subgroup of 7 patients (18%) showed relatively high gain in vestibulo-ocular reflex on the surgery side. Caloric reaction was absent in all cases. These findings indicate that residual vestibular function can be conserved following vestibular schwannoma extirpation.


CONCLUSION
Cases with moderate vestibulo-ocular reflex gain were a subgroup with partial conservation of vestibular nerve fibers. Whether this is a predictor of better functional prognosis remains to be elucidated. Higher gain correlated with less extensive surgery and sparing of the inferior vestibular nerve. Low gain correlated with complete vestibular neurectomy. This information may guide rehabilitation strategy following surgery.",Zuzana Balatková;Silvie Hrubá;Michaela Danková;Petr Volf;Patrik Kutílek;Jan Plzák;Veronika Bandurová;Vladimír Koucký;Eva Mrázkova;Zdeněk Čada
176,Giulia Prando,"Contemporary neuroscience has embraced network science and dynamical systems to study the complex and self-organized structure of the human brain. Despite the developments in non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, a full understanding of the directed interactions in whole brain networks, referred to as effective connectivity, as well as their role in the emergent brain dynamics is still lacking. The main reason is that estimating brain connectivity requires solving a formidable large-scale inverse problem from indirect and noisy measurements. Building on the dynamic causal modelling framework, the present study offers a novel method for estimating whole-brain effective connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance data. To this purpose sparse estimation methods are adapted to infer the parameters of our novel model, which is based on a linearized, region-specific haemodynamic response function. The resulting Algorithm is shown to compare favorably with state-of-the art methods when tested on both synthetic and real data. We also provide a graph-theoretical analysis on the whole-brain effective connectivity estimated using data from a cohort of healthy individuals, which reveals properties such as asymmetry in the connectivity structure as well as the different roles of brain areas in favoring segregation or integration.",Mattia Zorzi;Alessandra Bertoldo;Maurizio Corbetta;Marco Zorzi;Alessandro Chiuso
177,Jonas Bause,"Functional imaging with sub-millimeter spatial resolution is a basic requirement for assessing functional MRI (fMRI) responses across different cortical depths, and is used extensively in the emerging field of laminar fMRI. Such studies seek to investigate the detailed functional organization of the brain and may develop to a new powerful tool for human neuroscience. However, several studies have shown that measurement of laminar fMRI responses can be biased by the image acquisition and data processing strategies. In this work, measurements with three different gradient-echo EPI protocols with a voxel size down to 650 μm isotropic were performed at 9.4 T. We estimated how prospective motion correction can help to improve spatial accuracy by reducing the number of spatial resampling steps in postprocessing. In addition, we demonstrate key requirements for accurate geometric distortion correction to ensure that distortion correction maps are properly aligned to the functional data and that strong variations of distortions near large veins can lead to signal overlays which cannot be corrected for during postprocessing. Furthermore, this study illustrates the spatial extent of bias induced by pial and other larger veins in laminar BOLD experiments. Since these issues under investigation affect studies performed with more conventional spatial resolutions, the methods applied in this work may also help to improve the understanding of the BOLD signal more broadly.",Jonathan R Polimeni;Johannes Stelzer;Myung-Ho In;Philipp Ehses;Pablo Kraemer-Fernandez;Ali Aghaeifar;Eric Lacosse;Rolf Pohmann;Klaus Scheffler
178,Emily Hill,"The neuromodulator adenosine is released during seizure activity to provide negative feedback suppression of on-going activity and to delay the occurrence of the next burst of activity. Adenosine acts via multiple G protein coupled receptors including the A1 receptor (A1R) which inhibits neurotransmitter release and hyperpolarises neuronal membrane potential. The hyperpolarisation is produced, at least in part, by the activation of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. We have used tertiapin-Q (TQ), a potent and selective inhibitor of GIRK channels, to assess the role of GIRK channels in controlling seizure activity in areas CA1 and CA2 of mouse hippocampal slices. TQ (100-300 nM) blocked ∼50% of the adenosine-mediated membrane potential hyperpolarisation of hippocampal CA1 and CA2 neurons. TQ (100 nM) had no significant effect on synaptic transmission in area CA1 of the hippocampus but enhanced transmission in CA2, an effect prevented by blocking A1Rs. TQ (100 nM) increased the frequency of spontaneous activity (induced by removing Mg2+ and increasing K+) and blunted the effects of exogenous adenosine on the suppression of activity. TQ had a significantly greater effect on electrically-stimulated seizure activity induced in CA2 versus that in CA1, producing a greater increase in both the duration and amplitude of the stimulated bursts. This is consistent with the greater A1R density and A1R activation tone in CA2. Thus GIRK channels play a role in the supressing effects of adenosine on seizure activity.",Charlotte Hickman;Rebecca Diez;Mark Wall
179,Qian Cui,"Previous studies have reported abnormalities in static brain activity and connectivity in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the dynamic patterns of brain connectivity in patients with GAD have not been fully explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic local brain functional connectivity in patients with GAD using dynamic regional phase synchrony (DRePS), a newly developed method for assessing intrinsic dynamic local functional connectivity. Seventy-four patients with GAD and 74 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to the HCs, patients with GAD exhibited decreased DRePS values in the bilateral caudate, left hippocampus, left anterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus extending to inferior temporal gyrus. The DRePS value of the left hippocampus was negatively correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Moreover, these abnormal DRePS patterns could be used to distinguish patients with GAD from HCs in an independent sample (18 patients with GAD and 21 HCs). Our findings provide further evidence on brain dysfunction in GAD from the perspective of the dynamic behaviour of local connections, suggesting that patients with GAD may have an insufficient brain adaptation. This study provides new insights into the neurocognitive mechanism of GAD and could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Future studies on GAD could benefit from combining the DRePS method with task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and non-invasive brain stimulation.",Yuyan Chen;Qin Tang;Shaoqiang Han;Shan Hu;Yajing Pang;Fengmei Lu;Xiaoyu Nan;Wei Sheng;Qian Shen;Yifeng Wang;Zongling He;Huafu Chen
180,F M Merced-Nieves,"Maternal prenatal stress can adversely impact subsequent child neurodevelopment, but little is known about its effect on cognitive development in infancy. This analysis of 107 infants from a prospective birth cohort assessed whether prenatal stress disrupts sexually dimorphic performance typically observed on a physical reasoning task. Maternal stress was assessed at 8-14 and 33-37 gestational weeks using the Perceived Stress Scale. Stress was defined as: low (scores below the median at both times), medium (scores above the median at one of the two times), and high (scores above the median at both times). At 4.5 months infants saw videos of two events: one impossible and the other possible. In the impossible event a box was placed against a wall without support underneath. In the possible event the box was placed against the wall, supported by the floor. Looking time at each event was recorded via infrared eye-tracking. Previous literature has shown that, at 4.5 months of age, girls typically look significantly longer at the impossible than at the possible event, suggesting that they expect the unsupported box to fall and are surprised when it does not. Boys tend to look equally at the two events suggesting that they do not share this expectation. This sex difference was replicated in the current study. General linear models stratified by sex and adjusted for household income, maternal education, mother's age at birth, infant's age at exam, and order of event presentation revealed that girls whose mothers reported high perceived stress during pregnancy had shorter looking time differences between the impossible and possible events than girls whose mothers reported low perceived stress (β = -7.1; 95% CI: -12.0, -2.2 s; p = 0.006). Similar to boys, girls in the highest stress category spent about the same amount of time looking at each event. For boys, there were no significant looking time differences by maternal stress level. This finding suggests prenatal stress is associated with a delay in the development of physical reasoning in girls.",A Aguiar;K L C Dzwilewski;S Musaad;S A Korrick;S L Schantz

184,Luis E Almaguer-Mederos,"BACKGROUND
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to a CAG-repeat expansion. This work is intended to identify modifiers of the clinical phenotype in SCA2, following up on recent genome-wide association analyses that demonstrated the prominent role of DNA-damage repair and methylation for the severity and progression of polyglutamine diseases. In particular, we assessed the impact of MTHFR as rate-limiting enzyme in DNA methylation pathways, which modulates cerebellar neurotransmission and motor neuron atrophy.


METHODS
A sample of 166 Cuban SCA2 patients and of 130 healthy subjects from the same geographical and ethnic background was selected. The ATXN2 CAG repeat length was determined by PCR followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two amino acid substitutions known to decrease the enzyme activity of MTHFR, encoded by C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, were assessed by PCR/RFLP.


RESULTS
No significant differences were observed for C677T or A1298C alleles or genotype frequencies between cases and controls, confirming that disease risk in SCA2 does not depend on MTHFR activity. However, MTHFR A1298C genotypes showed a significant association with saccade latency.


CONCLUSIONS
\MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with saccade latency in SCA2 patients, but not with disease risk, age at onset or maximal saccade velocity.

185,Landon J Dittel,"BACKGROUND
EAE is an inflammatory autoimmune process of the CNS that resembles multiple sclerosis (MS) and provides a useful animal model for the evaluation of mechanisms of action for potential immunomodulatory therapies. Oral ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) can decrease clinical disease, IL-17 and Th1-like encephalitogenic IFN-γ secretion and increase Treg frequency. The mechanism by which oral ACTH decreases inflammatory proteins and increases Treg cell frequencies is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
IL-6 is a pivotal cytokine in the gut that determines the relative frequencies of Th17 vs Treg cells. We examined whether oral ACTH inhibited IL-6 in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in EAE.


DESIGN/METHODS
B6 mice were immunized with MOG peptide 35-55 and gavaged with scrambled ACTH (scrambled melanocyte stimulating hormone [scrambled α-MSH]) or ACTH 1-39 during ongoing disease.


RESULTS
Ingested (oral) ACTH inhibited ongoing clinical disease. In the lamina propria (LP) immune compartment, there were significantly less CD11b + IL-6 and IL-17 producing lymphocytes from ACTH fed mice compared to s-MSH fed mice. There was also a decrease in the frequency of IL-17 and IFN-γ producing spleen cells and an increase in CD4 + FoxP3+ Treg cell frequency in ACTH fed mice compared to s-MSH fed control spleens. There were less IFN-γ producing CNS lymphocytes in ACTH fed mice compared to s-MSH fed control CNS.

To identify timing for initiation of anticoagulation therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with non-valvular AF as regards safety and efficacy by detecting the rate of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and recurrent ischemic symptoms (RIS) during follow-up.


METHODS
This is a prospective observational cohort study conducted at King Fahd Hospital of the University including 120 patients with AIS/TIAs from July 2016 till July 2018. We compared patients who received anticoagulants 1-6 days (Group I (45.83%), 7-14 days, Group II (35%), and > 14 days after the ischemic event (Group III (19.17%). Follow-up was at least 3 months and included identifying ICH or RIS.


RESULT
ICH has occurred in 26.67% (n = 32) patients with a highly statistically significant association with time of treatment (P-value = .01) being higher in group I (n = 17) compared to only 1 case in group III. Subgroup analyses on the ICH patients (n = 32) has revealed statistical significant association with higher NIHSS score (P = .001). Also, the type of anticoagulants used between three groups pointed to an association existence (p = .02), however, the direction of this association cannot be determined. There was no statistical significant association between RIS (occurred in 4.16% (n = 5) with time of treatment (P = .754).

187,Emma Murray,"Puberty is a critical period of neural development, and exposure to stress and inflammation during this period is thought to increase vulnerability to mental illness. The gut microbiome influences brain functioning and behavior and impacts mental health. Yet, the role of the gut microbiome during puberty, a period during which mental health conditions tend to onset, remains largely uninvestigated. We first examined age and sex differences in gut microbial changes among CD-1 mice exposed to an immune challenge (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) at 6 weeks of age (during the pubertal stress-sensitive period) or at 10 weeks of age (in adulthood) (Experiment 1). Compared to their adult counterparts, pubertal males and females showed more significant changes in gut microbial composition following LPS treatment, including the depletion of numerous bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus. Given the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus strains on stress and behaviour, we next investigated whether replenishment of the gut with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) throughout pubertal development would modulate LPS-induced sickness and enduring effects on memory dysfunction, anxiety-like behaviour and stress reactivity in adulthood (Experiment 2). LPS treatment at 6 weeks of age created enduring changes in anxiety-like behaviors among males only. Similarly, only males showed the protective effects of L. reuteri supplementation during puberty in preventing longstanding LPS-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior and stress-induced brain activation. These findings demonstrate that colonizing the gut with L. reuteri during puberty modulates sickness responses and enduring behavioural and neurochemical outcomes in a sex-specific manner.

189,Anne M Verstegen,"BACKGROUND
Our understanding of the neural circuits controlling micturition and continence is constrained by a paucity of techniques for measuring voiding in awake, behaving mice.


NEW METHOD
To facilitate progress in this area, we developed a new, non-invasive assay, micturition video thermography (MVT), using a down-facing thermal camera above mice on a filter paper floor.


RESULTS
Most C57B6/J mice void infrequently, with a stereotyped behavioral sequence, and usually in a corner. The timing of each void is indicated by the warm thermal contrast of freshly voided urine. Over the following 10-15 min, urine cools to ∼3 °C below the ambient temperature and spreads radially in the filter paper. By measuring the area of cool contrast comprising this ""thermal void spot,"" we can derive the initially voided volume. Thermal videos also reveal mouse behaviors including a home-corner preference apart from void spots, and a stereotyped, seconds-long pause while voiding.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS AND CONCLUSIONS
MVT is a robust, non-invasive method for measuring the timing, volume, and location of voiding. It improves on an existing technique, the void spot assay, by adding timing information, and unlike the cystometrogram preparation, MVT does not require surgical catheterization. Combining MVT with current neuroscience techniques will improve our understanding of the neural circuits that control continence, which is important for addressing the growing number of patients with urinary incontinence as the population ages.",Margaret M Tish;Luca P Szczepanik;Mark L Zeidel;Joel C Geerling
190,Marinho A Lopes,"OBJECTIVE
The effectiveness of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to inform epilepsy surgery depends on where iEEG electrodes are implanted. This decision is informed by noninvasive recording modalities such as scalp EEG. Herein we propose a framework to interrogate scalp EEG and determine epilepsy lateralization to aid in electrode implantation.


METHODS
We use eLORETA to map source activities from seizure epochs recorded from scalp EEG and consider 15 regions of interest (ROIs). Functional networks are then constructed using the phase-locking value and studied using a mathematical model. By removing different ROIs from the network and simulating their impact on the network's ability to generate seizures in silico, the framework provides predictions of epilepsy lateralization. We consider 15 individuals from the EPILEPSIAE database and study a total of 62 seizures. Results were assessed by taking into account actual intracranial implantations and surgical outcome.


RESULTS
The framework provided potentially useful information regarding epilepsy lateralization in 12 out of the 15 individuals (p=0.02, binomial test).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results show promise for the use of this framework to better interrogate scalp EEG to determine epilepsy lateralization.

192,Farzad Salehpour,"The application of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for neuronal stimulation is studied in different animal models and in humans, and has shown to improve cerebral metabolic activity and blood flow, and provide neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways. Recently, intranasal PBMT (i-PBMT) has become an attractive and potential method for the treatment of brain conditions. Herein, we provide a summary of different intranasal light delivery approaches including a nostril-based portable method and implanted deep-nasal methods for the effective systemic or direct irradiation of the brain. Nostril-based i-PBMT devices are available, using either lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), and can be applied either alone or in combination to transcranial devices (the latter applied directly to the scalp) to treat a wide range of brain conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, depression and anxiety as well as insomnia. Evidence shows that nostril-based i-PBMT improves blood rheology and cerebral blood flow, so that, without needing to puncture blood vessels, i-PBMT may have equivalent results to a peripheral intravenous laser irradiation procedure. Up to now, no studies were conducted to implant PBMT light sources deep within the nose in a clinical setting, but simulation studies suggest that deep-nasal PBMT via cribriform plate and sphenoid sinus might be an effective method to deliver light to the ventromedial part of the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex.

Vitamin D is involved in brain development and functioning, as well as in regulation of neurotrophic factors. Changes in the expression of those factors are possibly responsible for morphologic abnormalities and symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia.


OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this research was to investigate the interrelationship between vitamin D, nerve growth factors (NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], and neuregulin-1 [NRG1]), and schizophrenia symptom domains.


METHODS
This research included 97 inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Blood samples were taken in order to analyze concentrations of vitamin D, BDNF, NRG1, and NGF growth factors. The obtained results were used in a multiple regression analysis.


RESULTS
The vitamin D concentration positively affected the concentration of NRG1 (F = 8.583, p = 0.005) but not the concentration of other investigated growth factors (BDNF and NGF). The clinical characteristics and symptom domains of schizophrenia seemed to be unaffected by the concentrations of vitamin D, BDNF, and NGF, while the NRG1 concentration significantly affected positive symptom domains of schizophrenia (F = 4.927, p = 0.030).


CONCLUSION
The vitamin D concentration positively affected NRG1 levels but not schizophrenia symptomatology as measured by PANSS. The as-sociation between the two could be intermediated via NRG1.",Ante Silić;Ivona Orlović;Branka Vidrih;Danijel Crnković;Dalibor Karlović

The prevalence and incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not fully established, and this varies depending on the studied population.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate the prevalence/incidence of ALS patients in Antioquia-Colombia.


METHODOLOGY
Observational/descriptive study by reviewing clinical records from 2010 to 2014. Cases with possible, probable and definite ALS were included. To estimate the prevalence/incidence, capture-recapture method was used.


RESULTS
Point prevalence in December 2014 was 4.9/100,000 (95% CI 2.0-7.8), and the incidence was 1.4/100,000/year (95% CI 0.5-2.2). The median survival was 4 years. Spinal-onset was observed in 62.4% of the included patients.


CONCLUSION
Prevalence, incidence and clinical presentation of ALS in Antioquia are similar to most studies reported worldwide. However, prevalence in Antioquia seems to be slightly higher than in other studies from Latin -American countries. This may derive from the inclusion criteria and case detection methodology adopted, but sociodemographic and genetic factors should be considered.",Edwing Franco Dáger;Daniel C Aguirre-Acevedo;Mamede de Carvalho;Juan Solano-Atehortúa
195,Jaime Luna,"INTRODUCTION
Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. The distribution of these disorders differs significantly in developing countries. Screening questionnaires have been used as an important tool to detect neurological illnesses. This systematic literature review aimed to report the validity of screening questionnaires for neurological disorders in developing countries.


METHODS
The PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Science-Direct, and PASCAL databases were searched. All published studies performed in developing countries were eligible. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 tool. Summary measures of validity were reported (sensitivity and specificity).


RESULTS
Eight hundred and thirty-five records were identified, and 49 articles that met eligibility criteria were selected. The most frequently neurological disorders detected with a screening tool were epilepsy, stroke, and neuropathies (77, 53, and 40%, respectively). Ten screening questionnaires were accessible. Two questionnaires were mainly used to detect neurological disorders: the World Health Organization Protocol for Epidemiologic Studies of Neurologic Disorders and the Ten Questions Questionnaire. The sensitivity of the questionnaires was ranged from 84 to 100% and 56 to 100%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
This systematic review presents evidence that screening questionnaires are valid tools to detect neurological disorders in developing countries. Disease detection provides epidemiological data and the opportunity to implement secondary and tertiary prevention strategies that will contribute to reduce the global burden of neurological disorders.",Charline Leroi;Pierre-Marie Preux;Edgard Brice Ngoungou;Benoît Marin;Farid Boumediene
196,Francisco Donoso,"BACKGROUND
Polyphenols are phytochemicals that have been associated with therapeutic effects in stress-related disorders. Indeed, studies suggest that polyphenols exert significant neuroprotection against multiple neuronal injuries, including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, but the mechanisms are unclear. Evidence indicates that polyphenol neuroprotection may be mediated by activation of Nrf2, a transcription factor associated with antioxidant and cell survival responses. On the other hand, in stress-linked disorders, Fkbp5 is a novel molecular target for treatment because of its capacity to regulate glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. However, it is not clear the role Fkbp5 plays in polyphenol-mediated stress modulation. In this study, the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of the naturally derived polyphenols xanthohumol and quercetin against cytotoxicity induced by corticosterone were investigated in primary cortical cells.


METHODS
Primary cortical cells containing both neurons and astrocytes were pre-incubated with different concentrations of quercetin and xanthohumol to examine the neuroprotective effects of polyphenols on cell viability, morphology, and gene expression following corticosterone insult.


RESULTS
Both polyphenols tested prevented the reduction of cell viability and alterations of neuronal/astrocytic numbers due to corticosterone exposure. Basal levels of Bdnf mRNA were also decreased after corticosterone insult; however, this was reversed by both polyphenol treatments. Interestingly, the Nrf2 inhibitor blocked xanthohumol but not quercetin-mediated neuroprotection. In contrast, we found that Fkbp5 expression is exclusively modulated by quercetin.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that naturally derived polyphenols protect cortical cells against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity and enhance cell survival via modulation of the Nrf2 pathway and expression of Fkbp5.",Valerie T Ramírez;Anna V Golubeva;Gerard M Moloney;Catherine Stanton;Timothy G Dinan;John F Cryan
197,Michael Schmutzer,"BACKGROUND
Spinal arachnoid cysts (SAC) are rare mostly idiopathic intradural lesions with compression of the spinal cord and clinical signs of radiculo- and/or myelopathy. We retrospectively analyzed radiological and clinical characteristics of patients with surgical treatment of SAC including a subgroup evaluation of long-term outcome and QoL.


METHOD
Patients with SAC treated between 1993 and 2017 were evaluated. Craniocaudal (c.c.) and anteroposterior (a.p) cyst diameters were measured pre- and post-OP. McCormick and Odom score for myelopathy, general outcome and QoL (SF-36, EORTC-QLQ30) were recorded.


RESULTS
A total of 72 patients (female:male = 1.9:1) were analyzed with mean FU of 44.8 ± 60 months (long-term data from 25 patients with FU 78.2 ± 63.9 months). All had surgery due to solitary cysts: 10 cervical (13.9%), 45 thoracic (62.5%), and 17 lumbosacral (23.6%), the majority (79.2%) located dorsally. Main symptoms were gait disturbance (80%), dysesthesia (64%) and paresis (80%). Patients had (hemi-)laminectomy with cyst fenestration in 48 (66.7%) and complete resection in 18 cases (25.0%). Four cases (5.5%) were treated by cystoperitoneal shunt, 2 by marsupialization (2.8%). In total, 11 revisions were necessary in 9/72 (12.5%) patients (one patient underwent 3 revisions). Two patients were reoperated for wound revision/epidural hematoma (each n = 1). Seven patients needed additional cyst wall resection after 1.5-31.0 months due to insufficient cyst shrinking and persistent clinical symptoms after first surgery; most of the cysts were multiple septated and of post-hemorrhagic origin. The mean c.c. size decreased from 5.2 ± 3.7 cm pre-OP to 2.7 ± 3.9 cm (p < 0.05); the a.p. diameter decreased from 1.0 ± 0.5 cm to 0.3 ± 0.3 cm (p < 0.0001) without significant differences between fenestration and resection. McCormick and Odom scores revealed improved symptoms, particularly of gait disturbance, sensory deficits, and general performance. Long-term FU displayed satisfying QoL performance without differences of fenestration or resection.


CONCLUSION
SAC mostly affect women and are predominantly located in the thoracic spine, becoming apparent with clinical myelopathy. For cysts without intracystic septae and compartments, both fenestration and resection of the cyst wall provided significant reduction of cyst size and clinical improvement.",Joerg-Christian Tonn;Stefan Zausinger
198,J-Y Puigbò,"In order to deal with the uncertainty in the world, our brains need to be able to flexibly switch between the exploration of new sensory representations and exploitation of previously acquired ones. This requires forming accurate estimations of what and how much something is expected. While modeling has allowed for the development of several ways to form predictions, how the brain could implement those is still under debate. Here, we recognize acetylcholine as one of the main neuromodulators driving learning based on uncertainty, promoting the exploration of new sensory representations. We identify its interactions with cortical inhibitory interneurons and derive a biophysically grounded computational model able to capture and learn from uncertainty. This model allows us to understand inhibition beyond gain control by suggesting that different interneuron subtypes either encode predictions or estimate their uncertainty, facilitating detection of unexpected cues. Moreover, we show how acetylcholine-like neuromodulation uniquely interacts with global and local sources of inhibition, disrupting perceptual certainty and promoting the rapid acquisition of new perceptual cues. Altogether, our model proposes that cortical acetylcholine favors sensory exploration over exploitation in a cortical microcircuit dedicated to estimating sensory uncertainty.",X D Arsiwalla;M A González-Ballester;P F M J Verschure
199,Daniel Leite Góes Gitaí,"An initial precipitating injury in the brain, such as after status epilepticus (SE), evolves into chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We investigated changes in the miRNA composition of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the forebrain after the establishment of SE-induced chronic TLE. We induced SE in young Fischer 344 rats through graded intraperitoneal injections of kainic acid, which resulted in consistent spontaneous recurrent seizures at ~ 3 months post-SE. We isolated EVs from the entire forebrain of chronically epileptic rats and age-matched naïve control animals through an ultracentrifugation method and performed miRNA-sequencing studies to discern changes in the miRNA composition of forebrain-derived EVs in chronic epilepsy. EVs from both naïve and epileptic forebrains displayed spherical or cup-shaped morphology, a comparable size range, and CD63 expression but lacked the expression of a deep cellular marker GM130. However, miRNA-sequencing studies suggested downregulation of 3 miRNAs (miR-187-5p, miR-346, and miR-331-3p) and upregulation of 4 miRNAs (miR-490-5p, miR-376b-3p, miR-493-5p, and miR-124-5p) in EVs from epileptic forebrains with fold changes ranging from 1.5 to 2.4 (p < 0.0006; FDR < 0.05). By using geNorm and Normfinder software, we identified miR-487 and miR-221 as the best combination of reference genes for measurement of altered miRNAs found in the epileptic forebrain through qRT-PCR studies. The validation revealed that only miR-346 and miR-331-3p were significantly downregulated in EVs from the epileptic forebrain. The enrichment pathway analysis of these miRNAs showed an overrepresentation of signaling pathways that are linked to molecular mechanisms underlying chronic epilepsy, including GABA-ergic (miR-346 targets) and mTOR (miR-331-3p targets) systems. Thus, the packaging of two miRNAs into EVs in neural cells is considerably altered in chronic epilepsy. Functional studies on these two miRNAs may uncover their role in the pathophysiology and treatment of TLE.",Ygor Daniel Ramos Dos Santos;Raghavendra Upadhya;Maheedhar Kodali;Leelavathi N Madhu;Ashok K Shetty
200,Wei-Ping Jen,"The Twist basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 (Twist1) has been implicated in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis, due to its effects on cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis signaling. Interestingly, a connection between Twist1 and neurotoxicity was recently made in mutant huntingtin (mHtt)-expressing primary cortical neurons; however, the role of Twist1 in Huntington's disease (HD)-affected striatal neurons remains undescribed. In this study, we evaluated the expression and function of Twist1 in the R6/2 HD mouse model, which expresses the polyQ-expanded N-terminal portion of human HTT protein, and a pair of striatal progenitor cell lines (STHdhQ109 and STHdhQ7), which express polyQ-expanded or non-expanded full-length mouse Htt. We further probed upstream signaling events and Twist1 anti-apoptotic function in the striatal progenitor cell lines. Twist1 was increased in mHtt-expressing striatal progenitor cells (STHdhQ109) and was correlated with disease progression in striatum and cortex brain regions of R6/2 mice. In the cell model, downregulation of Twist1 induced death of STHdhQ109 cells but had no effect on wild-type striatal progenitor cells (STHdhQ7). Twist1 knockdown stimulated caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were increased in HD striatal progenitor cells and acted as an upstream regulator of Twist1. As such, inhibition of STAT3 induced apoptosis in HD striatal progenitor cells. Our results suggest that mHtt upregulates STAT3 to induce Twist1 expression. Upregulated Twist1 inhibits apoptosis, which may protect striatal cells from death during disease progression. Thus, we propose that Twist1 might play a protective role against striatal degeneration in HD.",Hui-Mei Chen;Yow-Sien Lin;Yijuang Chern;Yi-Ching Lee
201,Damien P Kuffler,"Injury typically results in the development of neuropathic pain, but the pain normally decreases and disappears in paralleled with wound healing. The pain results from cells resident at, and recruited to, the injury site releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators leading to the development of pro-inflammatory environment and causing nociceptive neurons to develop chronic ectopic electrical activity, which underlies neuropathic pain. The pain decreases as some of the cells that induce pro-inflammation, changing their phenotype leading to the blocking the release of pro-inflammatory mediators while releasing anti-inflammatory mediators, and blocking nociceptive neuron chronic spontaneous electrical activity. Often, despite apparent wound healing, the neuropathic pain becomes chronic. This raises the question of how chronic pain can be eliminated. While many of the cells and mediators contributing to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain are known, a better understanding is required of how the injury site environment can be controlled to permanently eliminate the pro-inflammatory environment and silence the chronically electrically active nociceptive neurons. This paper examines how methods that can promote the transition of the pro-inflammatory injury site to an anti-inflammatory state, by changing the composition of local cell types, modifying the activity of pro- and anti-inflammatory receptors, inducing the release of anti-inflammatory mediators, and silencing the chronically electrically active nociceptive neurons. It also examines the hypothesis that factors released from platelet-rich plasma applied to chronic pain sites can permanently eliminate chronic inflammation and its associated chronic pain.",NA
202,Shi-Ying Fan,"OBJECTIVE
To compare the efficacy of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease, and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms.


METHODS
We retrospectively assessed clinical outcomes in 43 patients with preoperative LID who underwent DBS targeting the STN (20/43) or GPi (23/43). The primary clinical outcome was the change from baseline in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and secondary outcomes included changes in the total daily levodopa equivalent dose, the drug-off Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅲ at the last follow-up (median, 18 months), adverse effects, and programming settings. Correlation analysis was used to find potential associated factors that could be used to predict the efficacy of DBS for dyskinesia management.


RESULTS
Compared to baseline, both the STN group and the GPi group showed significant improvement in LID with 60.73 ± 40.29% (mean ± standard deviation) and 93.78 ± 14.15% improvement, respectively, according to the UDysRS score. Furthermore, GPi-DBS provided greater clinical benefit in the improvement of dyskinesia (P < 0.05) compared to the STN. Compared to the GPi group, the levodopa equivalent dose reduction was greater in the STN group at the last follow-up (43.81% vs. 13.29%, P < 0.05). For the correlation analysis, the improvement in the UDysRS outcomes were significantly associated with a reduction in levodopa equivalent dose in the STN group (r = 0.543, P = 0.013), but not in the GPi group (r = -0.056, P = 0.801).


INTERPRETATION
Both STN and GPi-DBS have a beneficial effect on LID but GPi-DBS provided greater anti-dyskinetic effects. Dyskinesia suppression for STN-DBS may depend on the reduction of levodopa equivalent dose. Unlike the STN, GPi-DBS might exert a direct and independent anti-dyskinesia effect.",Kai-Liang Wang;Wei Hu;Robert S Eisinger;Alexander Han;Chun-Lei Han;Qiao Wang;Shimabukuro Michitomo;Jian-Guo Zhang;Feng Wang;Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora;Fan-Gang Meng

204,Thijs Vande Vyvere,"PURPOSE
To aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of using the NINDS standardized imaging-based pathoanatomic descriptors for the evaluation and reporting of acute TBI lesions.


METHODS
For a total of 3,392 patients (2,244 males and 1,148 females, Median = 51 years) enrolled in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study, we extracted 96 CDEs from the structured reports, spanning all three levels of pathoanatomic information (i.e. 20 ""basic"", 60 ""descriptive"" and 16 ""advanced"" CDE variables per patient). 6-month clinical outcome scores were dichotomized into favorable (GOS-E = 5-8) versus unfavorable (GOS-E = 1-4). Regularized logistic regression models were constructed and compared using the optimism-corrected AUC.


RESULTS
An abnormality was reported for the majority of patients (64.51%). In 79.11% of those patients, there was at least one coexisting pathoanatomic lesion or associated finding. An increase in lesion severity, laterality and volume was associated with more unfavorable outcomes. Compared to the full set of pathoanatomic descriptors (i.e. all three categories of information), reporting ""basic"" CDE information provides at least equal discrimination between patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome (AUC = 0.8121 vs. 0.8155, respectively). Addition of a selected subset of ""descriptive"" detail (i.e. location and volume) to specific basic CDEs could improve outcome prediction (AUC = 0.8248). Addition of ""advanced"" or ""emerging"" information had minimal prognostic value.


CONCLUSION
Our results show that the NINDS standardized-imaging based pathoanatomic descriptors can be used in large-scale studies and provide important insights into acute TBI lesion patterns. When used in clinical predictive models, they can provide excellent discrimination between patients with favorable and unfavorable 6-month outcomes. If further validated, our findings could support the development of structured and itemized templates in routine clinical radiology.

205,Amin Adeli,"The aim of the current study was to determine the possible interaction of the central leptin and Glutamatergic systems on feeding behavior in neonatal 3-hours food deprived (FD3) broilers chickens. In experiment 1, FD3 chicken received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of control solution (group i) and 2.5, 5 and 10 µg of Leptin (groups ii-iv). In experiment 2, FD3 chicken were ICV injected with (group i) control solution and groups ii-iv with 2.5, 5 and 10 nmol of AG-490 (JAK2 antagonist). In experiment 3, injections were (i) control solution, (ii) Leptin (10 µg), (iii) AG-490 (2.5 nmol) and (iv) Leptin + AG-490. In experiment 4, broiler chickens were ICV injected with (i) control solution, (ii) Leptin (10µg), (iii) MK-801 (NMDA glutamate receptors antagonist; 15nmol) and (iv) Leptin + MK-801. Experiments 5-9 were similar to experiment 1, except chicken were ICV injected with CNQX (AMPA receptor antagonist, 390nmol), UBP-302 (Kainate receptor antagonist, 390nmol), AIDA (mGluR1 antagonist, 2nmol), LY341495 (mGluR2 antagonist, 150nmol) and UBP1112 (mGluR3 antagonist, 2nmol) instead of MK-801. Then, food intake was measured until 120 minutes after injection. ICV injection of leptin (2.5, 5 and 10µg) significantly decreased food intake in a dose dependent manner (P < 0.05). Also, ICV injection of the JAK2 antagonist (2.5, 5 and 10 nmol) had hyperphagic effect in chicken(P < 0.05). Co-administration of leptin + AG-490, partially decreased leptin-induced hypophagia in broiler chicken (P < 0.05). In addition, co-injection of leptin + MK-801 significalty inhibited leptin-induced hypophagia in neonatal chicken (P < 0.05). Also, co-administration of leptin + CNQX partially attenuated hypophagic effect of leptin in chicken (P < 0.05).

NF-κB may be involved in the secondary injury of SCI that is mediated by inflammation and aggravates damage. Our study was aimed to investigate the role of NF-κB signaling in DUSP19-mediated cleaved Caspase-3 expression and the release of inflammatory factors in vivo and in vitro.Materials and Methods: DUSP19 mRNA expression and the content of IL-6 and IL-8 in patients with traumatic SCI (TSCI) were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The levels of p-NF-κBp65, NF-κBp65 and cleaved Caspase-3 expression and the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured by western blotting and ELISA, respectively.Results: Patients with TSCI showed lower DUSP19 expression and higher concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with healthy controls. DUSP19 overexpression inhibited p-NF-κBp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and production of IL-8 and IL-6 in the mice induced by TSCI. DUSP19 silencing increased p-NF-κBp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in mouse primary microglia cells. DUSP19 overexpression had an inverse effect. Importantly, DUSP19 silencing and overexpression mediated p-NF-κBp65 level, cleaved Caspase-3 expression, and concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in mouse primary microglia cells were reversed by NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and NF-κB activator 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), respectively.Conclusion: These results suggested that DUSP19-mediated SCI-induced apoptosis and inflammation via NF-κB signaling and might therefore serve as a potential therapeutic target for SCI.",Zheng-Kuan Xu;Kan Xu;Yu-Xiang Xiao
208,Pratik Parikh,"Advances in neonatology have led to unprecedented improvements in neonatal survival such that those born as early as 22 weeks of gestation now have some chance of survival, and over 70% of those born at 24 weeks of gestation survive. Up to 50% of infants born extremely preterm develop poor outcomes involving long-term neurodevelopmental impairments affecting cognition and learning, or motor problems such as cerebral palsy. Poor outcomes arise because the preterm brain is vulnerable both to direct injury (by events such as intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, and/or hypoxia), or indirect injury due to disruption of normal development. This neonatal brain injury and/or dysmaturation is called ""encephalopathy of prematurity"". Current and future strategies to improve outcomes in this population include prevention of preterm birth, and pre-, peri-, and postnatal approaches to protect the developing brain.

There are many similarities, with regards to brain lesions, for congenital Zika syndrome and congenital cytomegalovirus infection. Perinatally acquired viral infections tend to injure the white matter, with cystic evolution being more likely in the (late) preterm infant compared to the full-term infant.

211,Charbel El Kosseifi,"The new concept of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy is based on the understanding that many genetic epilepsies are associated with developmental impairment as a direct consequence of the genetic mutation, in addition to the effect of the frequent epileptic activity on brain development.

Some perinatal strokes are symptomatic in the first days of life, typically with seizures, including neonatal arterial ischemic stroke, neonatal hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The remaining subtypes present in the first year of life or later, usually with motor asymmetry and include arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke, presumed perinatal hemorrhagic stroke, and in utero periventricular venous infarction.

The objective was to assess the long-term respiratory function evolution for periods On-Idebenone compared to periods Off-Idebenone in the same patients. The mean idebenone exposure in the EAPs was 4.2 (range 2.4-6.1) years. The primary endpoint was the annual change in forced vital capacity percent of predicted (FVC%p) compared between Off-Idebenone and On-Idebenone periods. The annual rate of decline in FVC%p was reduced by approximately 50% from -7.4% (95% CI: -9.1, -5.8) for the Off-Idebenone periods to -3.8% (95% CI: -4.8, -2.8) for the On-Idebenone periods (N = 11). Similarly, annual change in peak expiratory flow percent of predicted (PEF%p) was -5.9% (95% CI: -8.0, -3.9) for the Off-Idebenone periods (N = 9) and reduced to -1.9% (95% CI: -3.2, -0.7) for the On-Idebenone periods during the EAPs. The reduced rates of decline in FVC%p and PEF%p were maintained for several years with possible beneficial effects on the rate of bronchopulmonary adverse events, time to 10% decline in FVC%p and risk of hospitalization due to respiratory cause. These long-term data provide Class IV evidence to further support the disease modifying treatment effect of idebenone previously observed in randomized, controlled trials.",Chiara S M Straathof;Ulrike Schara;Andrea Klein;Mika Leinonen;Shabir Hasham;Thomas Meier;Liesbeth De Waele;Heather Gordish-Dressman;Craig M McDonald;Oscar H Mayer;Thomas Voit;Eugenio Mercuri;Gunnar M Buyse;
219,Chan-Mi Kim,"Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), an indicator of neurovascular processes and metabolic demands, is a common finding in Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about what contributes to CBF deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We examine regional CBF differences in 17 MCI compared with 21 age-matched cognitively healthy older adults. Next, we examined associations between CBF, white matter lesion (WML) volume, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and cortical thickness to better understand whether altered CBF was detectable before other markers and the potential mechanistic underpinnings of CBF deficits in MCI. MCI had significantly reduced CBF, whereas cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation were not affected. Reduced CBF was associated with the WML volume but not associated with other measures. Given the presumed vascular etiology of WML and relative worsening of vascular health in MCI, it may suggest CBF deficits result from early vascular as opposed to metabolic deficits in MCI. These findings may support vascular mechanisms as an underlying component of cognitive impairment.",Rachel L Alvarado;Kimberly Stephens;Hsiao-Ying Wey;Dany J J Wang;Elizabeth C Leritz;David H Salat
220,Alexander M Kulminski,"The role of even the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, in its etiology remains poorly understood. We examined molecular signatures of AD defined as differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns between AD-affected and -unaffected whites (2673/16,246), Hispanics (392/867), and African Americans (285/1789), separately. We focused on 29 polymorphisms from 5 genes in the APOE region emphasizing beneficial and adverse effects of the APOE ε2- and ε4-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively, and the differences in the linkage disequilibrium structures involving these alleles between AD-affected and -unaffected subjects. Susceptibility to AD is likely the result of complex interactions of the ε2 and ε4 alleles with other polymorphisms in the APOE region, and these interactions differ across races/ethnicities corroborating differences in the adverse and beneficial effects of the ε4 and ε2 alleles. Our findings support complex race/ethnicity-specific haplotypes promoting and protecting against AD in this region. They contribute to better understanding of polygenic and resilient mechanisms, which can explain why even homozygous ε4 carriers may not develop AD.",Leonardo Shu;Yury Loika;Alireza Nazarian;Konstantin Arbeev;Svetlana Ukraintseva;Anatoliy Yashin;Irina Culminskaya
221,Claire E Shepherd,"Clusterin (CLU) is a pleiotropic glycoprotein that exists as a secreted, neuroprotective or intracellular, neurotoxic form, both of which increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) causing increased Aβ42 deposition. No studies have assessed the association between functionally distinct alloforms of CLU and tau protein or neuronal loss, despite its intracellular toxicity. We confirm previous reports of significant increases in both intracellular CLU and secreted CLU in the brain tissue of individuals with AD (p < 0.01) and show no association with neuronal loss. The increase in CLU alloforms was most closely associated with increases in both insoluble Aβ42 and tau protein (p = 0.001), supporting its role in AD pathogenesis. Further research should investigate whether altering human CLU levels may have viability as a therapeutic option for AD.",Andrew J Affleck;Anita Y Bahar;Francine Carew-Jones;Glenda M Halliday
222,Laura Bonfili,"Cerebral glucose homeostasis deregulation has a role in the pathogenesis and the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current therapies delay symptoms without definitively curing AD. We have previously shown that probiotics counteract AD progression in 3xTg-AD mice modifying gut microbiota and inducing energy metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis. Ameliorated cognition is based on higher neuroprotective gut hormones concentrations, reduced amyloid-β burden, and restored proteolytic pathways. Here, we demonstrate that probiotics oral administration improves glucose uptake in 3xTg-AD mice by restoring the brain expression levels of key glucose transporters (GLUT3, GLUT1) and insulin-like growth factor receptor β, in accordance with the diminished phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and protein-kinase B (Akt). In parallel, phosphorylated tau aggregates decrease in treated mice. Probiotics counteract the time-dependent increase of glycated hemoglobin and the accumulation of advanced glycation end products in AD mice, consistently with memory improvement. Collectively, our data elucidate the mechanism through which gut microbiota manipulation ameliorates impaired glucose metabolism in AD, finally delaying the disease progression.",Valentina Cecarini;Olee Gogoi;Sara Berardi;Silvia Scarpona;Mauro Angeletti;Giacomo Rossi;Anna Maria Eleuteri
223,Geoffrey Stanley,"The mammalian striatum is involved in many complex behaviors and yet is composed largely of a single neuron class: the spiny projection neuron (SPN). It is unclear to what extent the functional specialization of the striatum is due to the molecular specialization of SPN subtypes. We sought to define the molecular and anatomical diversity of adult SPNs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and quantitative RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). We computationally distinguished discrete versus continuous heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data and found that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four major discrete types with no implied spatial relationship between them. Within these discrete types, we find continuous heterogeneity encoding spatial gradients of gene expression and defining anatomical location in a combinatorial mechanism. Our results suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated, which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron.",Ozgun Gokce;Robert C Malenka;Thomas C Südhof;Stephen R Quake
224,Sehyoun Yoon,"Variants in the ANK3 gene encoding ankyrin-G are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. However, no upstream regulators of ankyrin-G at synapses are known. Here, we show that ankyrin-G interacts with Usp9X, a neurodevelopmental-disorder-associated deubiquitinase (DUB). Usp9X phosphorylation enhances their interaction, decreases ankyrin-G polyubiquitination, and stabilizes ankyrin-G to maintain dendritic spine development. In forebrain-specific Usp9X knockout mice (Usp9X-/Y), ankyrin-G as well as multiple ankyrin-repeat domain (ANKRD)-containing proteins are transiently reduced at 2 but recovered at 12 weeks postnatally. However, reduced cortical spine density in knockouts persists into adulthood. Usp9X-/Y mice display increase of ankyrin-G ubiquitination and aggregation and hyperactivity. USP9X mutations in patients with intellectual disability and autism ablate its catalytic activity or ankyrin-G interaction. Our data reveal a DUB-dependent mechanism of ANKRD protein homeostasis, the impairment of which only transiently affects ANKRD protein levels but leads to persistent neuronal, behavioral, and clinical abnormalities.",Euan Parnell;Maria Kasherman;Marc P Forrest;Kristoffer Myczek;Susitha Premarathne;Michelle C Sanchez Vega;Michael Piper;Thomas H J Burne;Lachlan A Jolly;Stephen A Wood;Peter Penzes
225,Nima Khalighinejad,"The medial frontal cortex has been linked to voluntary action, but an explanation of why decisions to act emerge at particular points in time has been lacking. We show that, in macaques, decisions about whether and when to act are predicted by a set of features defining the animal's current and past context; for example, respectively, cues indicating the current average rate of reward and recent previous voluntary action decisions. We show that activity in two brain areas-the anterior cingulate cortex and basal forebrain-tracks these contextual factors and mediates their effects on behavior in distinct ways. We use focused transcranial ultrasound to selectively and effectively stimulate deep in the brain, even as deep as the basal forebrain, and demonstrate that alteration of activity in the two areas changes decisions about when to act.",Alessandro Bongioanni;Lennart Verhagen;Davide Folloni;David Attali;Jean-Francois Aubry;Jerome Sallet;Matthew F S Rushworth
226,Luca Marchetti,"Neurobiological underpinnings of treatment-resistant depression, a debilitating condition associated with significant functional impairment, have not been elucidated. Consequently, the aim of this study was to use animal models of response and resistance to antidepressant treatment, in an attempt to identify differences in associated transcriptional responses. Flinders Sensitive Line rats were subjected to maternal separation (MS) and chronically treated with Escitalopram or Nortriptyline. Antidepressants reduced immobility time in the forced swim test in non-MS rats, while lack of antidepressant behavioural response was observed in MS animals. We developed a novel bioinformatic algorithm that enabled identification of transcriptional signatures in hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex that discriminate vehicle- and antidepressant-treated subjects in both MS and non-MS rats. Functional annotation analysis showed that in antidepressant-responder rats the most enriched pathways included IQGAPs activation, toll-like receptor trafficking, energy metabolism, and regulation of endopeptidase activity. The analysis of interacting proteins implicated synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release, ubiquitin regulation, cytoskeleton organisation and carbohydrate metabolism. In contrast, in treatment-resistant MS rats, main expression changes were revealed in ribosomal proteins, inflammatory responses, transcriptional/epigenetic regulation, and small GTPases. Susceptibility signature shared Rtn1, Zdhhc5, Igsf6, and Sim1 genes with the latest depression GWAS meta-analysis, while antidepressant resistance signature shared Ctnnd1, Rbms3, Atp1a3, and Pla2r1 genes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that distinct transcriptional signatures are associated with behavioural response or non-response to antidepressant treatment. The identification of genes involved in antidepressant response will increase the comprehension of the neurobiological underpinnings of treatment-resistant depression, thus contributing to identification of novel therapeutic targets.",Mario Lauria;Laura Caberlotto;Laura Musazzi;Maurizio Popoli;Aleksander A Mathé;Enrico Domenici;Lucia Carboni
227,Valery L Feigin,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. In the past 30 years, the absolute numbers of deaths and people with disabilities owing to neurological diseases have risen substantially, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and further increases are expected globally as a result of population growth and ageing. This rise in absolute numbers of people affected suggests that advances in prevention and management of major neurological disorders are not sufficiently effective to counter global demographic changes. Urgent measures to reduce this burden are therefore needed. Because resources for health care and research are already overstretched, priorities need to be set to guide policy makers, governments, and funding organisations to develop and implement action plans for prevention, health care, and research to tackle the growing challenge of neurological disorders.",Theo Vos;Emma Nichols;Mayowa O Owolabi;William M Carroll;Martin Dichgans;Günther Deuschl;Priya Parmar;Michael Brainin;Christopher Murray
228,Alfredo Ardila,"BACKGROUND
Cross-linguistic information about performance in neuropsychological verbal tests is extremely scarce. It has been suggested that verbal fluency test using animal fluency test is one of the few tests fulfilling the fundamental criteria desirable in a robust neuropsychological test.


OBJECTIVE
To compare and establish cross-linguistic information about performance in the animal fluency test.


RESULTS
In an extensive search, it was found that norms for the semantic fluency test using the category ANIMALS are available in 15 different languages. These languages represent a relatively broad spectrum of world languages, including not only Indo-European languages, but also Semitic, Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Dravidian, and even Amerindian languages. Normative data in these 15 languages are analyzed and the results are compared.


CONCLUSIONS
It is concluded that (a) pure linguistic factors, such as type of language and word-length, seemingly do not significantly affect the performance in this test; (b) two major demographic variables-age and education-account for a significant percentage of the variance in this test; the effect of sex seems to be neglectable; (c) in bilinguals, when the native language has few speakers and/or is a marginalized language, a very low score can be observed in the native language, even lower than in the second language; (d) there is a frequently overlooked major factor accounting for differences in cognitive test performance: the effort made in performing the test. It depends on the significance given to the test performance. Effort is quite variable across cultures and is higher in psychometric-oriented societies.",NA
229,Kati Hagström,"OBJECTIVE
We assess behavioral and attentional problems and neurocognitive functioning in school-aged children with primary snoring (PS).


METHODS
Seventeen children with PS and 27 non-snoring peers aged 6-10 years took part in the study. All children underwent a polysomnography (PSG) at the Sleep Laboratory. Snoring was defined by parents and with PSG. Children with obstructive sleep apnea were excluded. The parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Parents and teachers assessed behavioral and attentional problems with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised. Neuropsychological assessment included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY test).


RESULTS
The PS group had significantly more parent-reported internalizing, total, and attentional problems than the control group. Teachers did not report behavioral problems in the PS group. The PS and control groups had equal IQ scores and similar core neurocognitive functions, except for one visuospatial subtest. The PS group had significantly more inspiratory flow limitation and increased diaphragmatic electromyography compared with the controls. Parents reported significantly more daytime sleepiness in the PS group. Daytime sleepiness and snoring time were consistently associated with more behavioral and attentional problems. Flow limitation and more oxygen saturation values under 90% were associated with attentional problems, higher oxygen desaturation index, and lower mean oxygen saturation percentage with reduced language functions.


CONCLUSIONS
Snoring with an increase in respiratory effort without apneas and hypopneas and parent-reported daytime sleepiness may be linked to daytime symptoms. School-aged children with PS are at risk for behavioral and attentional problems, but not cognitive impairments.",Outi Saarenpää-Heikkilä;Sari-Leena Himanen;Anna-Maria Lampinlampi;Kati Rantanen
230,Sam Ng,"BACKGROUND
Therapeutic strategy concerning incidental low-grade glioma (ILGG) is still debated. Early ""prophylactic"" surgery has been proposed in asymptomatic patients with favorable neurological and oncological outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To assess postoperative ability to resume employment following awake surgery in asymptomatic ILGG patients. To assess extent of resection (EOR), timeline for adjuvant oncological treatment, and survival.


METHODS
A total of 74 patients with ILGG who underwent awake surgery with intraoperative mapping were prospectively included, with a minimum follow-up of 12 mo. All clinicoradiological data were collected, and statistical correlations with return to work (RTW) were performed.


RESULTS
A total of 66 patients (97.1%) among 68 patients with preoperative professional activities resumed their employment including 62 (91.2%) within 12 mo. Mean time before RTW was 6.8 mo (median: 6 mo, range: 1-36). Two patients experienced seizure-related legal issues impacting their RTW. Clinicoradiological features did not correlate with RTW apart from postoperative seizures (P = .02). Mean EOR was 95.7%. A total of 43 patients (58.1%) underwent supratotal/total resections. All patients recovered from transient deficits at 3 mo. No patients received consecutive adjuvant treatment. A total of 24 patients (32.4%) were reoperated, 24 patients received chemotherapy, and 7 patients (9.5%) received radiotherapy, on average 73.1 mo after surgery. Mean follow-up was 67 mo (range 12-240). Four patients (5.4%) died during the follow-up.


CONCLUSION
We observed a high rate of RTW (97.1%, including 91.2% within 12 mo) after awake surgery in ILGG patients. Delayed resumption of work was due to employer not clearing them for RTW, personal choice, and, in rare occasions, related to seizures.",Guillaume Herbet;Sylvie Moritz-Gasser;Hugues Duffau
